            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOw God of his mercy, according to his promiſe, hath made plain his Word, let us take heed that we are not found like thoſe that ſay to God, <hi>We deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy ways.</hi> Job <hi>21.14.</hi> But let all take to the Lord's direction in the ſearch of the Scriptures: For he ſaith, <hi>It is they that teſtifie of him.</hi> John <hi>5.39.</hi> Therefore we ſhould not lean to Man, nor our own received Opinion, but ſee if thoſe Truths which are here diſcovered, are not made plain by the Word. For the Scriptures, as they declare the Lord's firſt comming, ſo they do much more declare his ſecond coming to Judge and Reign, as by all the Prophets is foretold, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the Apoſtles confirmed. <hi>Acts
3.21.</hi> Now Chriſts firſt coming was but darkly ſet down, ſo as not only the Jews, but the Devils themſelves were deceived thereby, and therefore ſaid, <hi>Why art thou come to torment us before the time?</hi> as knowing that Chriſt had a time in which he ſhould Reign. And as Chriſt firſt comming was fulfilled in the Letter of the Word, ſo alſo will Chriſt's ſecond coming be fulfilled in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word. And it was becauſe of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſinfulneſs, that Chriſt was laid in <hi>Sion</hi> as a ſtumbling-ſtone, ſo as they knew not the day of their Viſitation, and how can we clear our ſelves of the like guiltineſs, as not to fear that that day ſhould overtake us as a ſnare, ſeeing alſo it was for ſin that the Gentile Churches were left to deluſion, becauſe they tooke pleaſure in Iniquity: but the firſt Churches were not in darkneſs, for that day to overtake them at unawares.</p>
            <p>How comes it then that we are ſo much in the dark as to this matter? Is it not becauſe of Sin, that we have loſt the knowledge of it? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo have no deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Lord ſaid, <hi>My People are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge.</hi> Hoſ. <hi>4.6.</hi> And not becauſe God had rebrobated them, nor becauſe they were not his People.</p>

                  <head>Chap. I. This is to prove when, and at what time the Believer is juſtified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law.</head>
                  <p>THAT it is at the Believer's firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of himſelf to Chriſt, in a willingneſs to take his Yoke upon him, ſo as to render his ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him; then is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to him for his Juſtification: This being according to what St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Churches at their firſt Reception, they being brought out of ſin, darkneſs, and errour: Therefore he ſaith of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins that are paſt.</hi> In theſe words he fully ſhews it was their ſins which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before converſion, which upon their converſion and reſignation of themſelves to Chriſt, they received remiſſion for thoſe paſt ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28:
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. Therefore the Apoſtle concludes that a man was juſtified by<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45720:4"/>faith without the deeds of the Law,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. that is, as before ſaid, at his firſt reſignation of himſelf to Chriſt, to yield him his love, and ſincere obedience; he is then juſtified by Chriſt without the deeds of the Law, from all his paſt ſins. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect, it is God that juſtifieth;</hi> for upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion they received remiſſion, ſo as none of their paſt ſins ſhould be laid to their charge; for God had then juſtified them by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and therefore he ſaith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10 4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth;</hi> the which belief muſt be in Chriſt and his VVord, in which he requires our love and ſincere obedience in all things, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 20. and then is Chriſt the end, fulfilling or com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>eating of the Law for their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for they are no ſooner thus juſtified by Chriſt, but they muſt live unto Chriſt, and then he will perſiſt to fulfil and compleat the end of the Law in them who continue to walk in ſincere obedience to him. And ſo the Apoſtle clearly explains theſe words, where he ſaith, <hi>Rom</hi> 8 4. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> Here he ſhews what <hi>us</hi> theſe are to whom the Law is thus fulfilled: That it was to as many of them as walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. And he alſo ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>For to be carnally
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45720:4"/>minded is death; but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace,</hi> v. 7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God: For it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be:</hi> Now tho' the carnal mind is at enmity againſt God, yet the Man is no longer at enmity againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>od, than he retains that carnal mind. So neither is the believer any longer a believer, than he retains a mind and will in Subjection to the Law of God; For he ſaith, Chap
6.16. <hi>His Servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church of
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are his Workmanſhip Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works which God had afore ordain'd that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> VVhich ſhews, they were no ſooner juſtified, and ſet clear from the guilt of ſin by the imputation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs, but it was alſo fore-ordained of God that they ſhould live in Good works, and therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Tree is known by its fruit,</hi> Mat. 7.17,20. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom.
10.9,10. <hi>That if thou confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made unto Salvation</hi> VVhich ſhews, if the belief in us does not produce a Righteous life, then it is altogether unavailable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:45720:5"/>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Tit.
3.5. <hi>It is not by works of Righteouſneſs, which they had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved them, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This alſo ſhews when they were thus ſaved from their Sins; That it was at their firſt converſion and reſignation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Chriſt. And he further ſhews how they were ſaved. That it was by the waſhing of Regeneration and the renewing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which was ſhed on them abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This was only at the eſtabliſhing of the firſt Chriſtian Churches, for it is evident, that there was no ſuch abundant pourings forth of Spirit upon believers afterwards. Therefore theſe places of Scripture are not fitly applicable to us, who are born <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and have the Call of the Goſpel, from whom is expected an improvement of the ſeaſon of Grace that God hath put into our hands. For altho' the Gentiles that had not the knowledge of God, were taken into mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy without works of Righteouſneſs; yet, the Jews who had the knowledge of God, were then excluded his mercy, becauſe there was not good works found in them; as God by all the Prophets, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, Matth.
23.23,24,25,26,27. <hi>Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye pay Tithe of Mint and Aniſe, and Cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mercy and faith: theſe ought ye to have done,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45720:5"/>and not to leave the other undone.</hi> Here theſe that had the knowledge of God, and the Law, the Practical part was firſt requir'd of them, as juſtice, and mercy; before any ground for a true faith to take place.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Galatians c.</hi> 3.
<hi>v.</hi> 21,22,23,24,25. <hi>Is the Law againſt the promiſes of God? God forbid for if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt
<hi>might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith, which ſhould afterwards be revealed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a School-maſter.</hi> Now whereas he ſaith the Law was their School-maſter to bring them to Chriſt. That is, the Law ſhewed them their inſufficiency for none being able to fulfil the moral Law to that perfection as to become juſtified by it, therefore it was as a School-maſter to bring them to look for juſtification from another. And alſo the Ceremonial law was as a School maſter to them, whereby that great Sacrifice was typified out to them, which only could make attonement for our ſins. And no ſooner was the Lord of life Crucified, which was that great Sacrifice which had been all along pointed at, but their<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45720:6"/>Sacrifices for ſin were aboliſhed. And the Believers, that by faith in Chriſt Jeſus took hold of the Offer of mercy according as it was offered by Chriſt, which is, that all ſhould have the free pardon of their ſins upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their future ſincere obedience. And ſo they then became juſtified without the deeds of the Law through the imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs: and their willingneſs for the future to render their ſincere obedience to all Chriſt's commands and precepts. For he that cometh after me, Chriſt ſaith, muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>For ye are all the Children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This he ſpeaks of them that had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the faith, and had received the Spirit. And thoſe of us that have taken Chriſt to have the ruling power in their hearts, in hopes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, are all the Children of God through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he chiefly ſpeaks of the inward bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of thoſe that have ſo put on Chriſt, as to have brought their thoughts and wills into ſubjection unto Chriſt. Therefore he ſaith to the Church, To as many of them as have ſo done, have put him on. And he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.
<hi>For he that cometh to God, muſt believe<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45720:6"/>that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. <hi>For what ſaith the Scripture,</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteouſneſs. Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of Grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for Righteouſneſs. Even as</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>alſo deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works, Saying, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whoſe ſins are covered. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin. Cometh this bleſſedneſs then upon the Circumciſion only, or upon the uncircumciſion alſo? For we ſay, that Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham
<hi>for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How was it then reckoned, when he was in Circumciſion, or in uncircumciſion? not in circumciſion, but in uncircumciſion.</hi> By theſe words it doth appear, that when
<hi>Abraham</hi> was received into mercy, he might have no works of Righteouſneſs of his own to repreſent him acceptable with God. But as the firſt Churches were brought out of darkneſs, Heatheniſm, and Error, and had not good works of their own, but they believing the promiſe, that upon confeſſing and forſaking their ſins, they ſhould find mercy by the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt; Who, according thereunto, did thus juſtifie the ungodly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45720:7"/>And as <hi>Abraham</hi> was accepted without the deeds of the Law, ſo <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all that were willing to joyn themſelves with them, were accepted without the deeds of the Law, when God brought them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> So the firſt Gentile Churches, for the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt, at their firſt reception, were accepted without works of righteouſneſs, or the deeds of the Law. And the Angel ſaid of Chriſt, that he ſhould be a light to lighten the Gentiles, before he ſaid, he ſhould be the glory of his people <hi>Iſrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> Luke
2.32. Therefore accordingly there was a great number of the Gentiles called in by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Spirit, with the tender of his grace. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the then times, ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26.
<hi>To declare, I ſay, at this time his Righteouſneſs: That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus.</hi> God is here ſaid to be juſt, in performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Chriſt concerning the calling in of the Gentiles: and in thus juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them that believed on Jeſus, which according to the conditions of the tender of his grace took hold of his mercy.</p>
                  <p>So we ſee there was a three-fold day of grace, without the deeds of the Law. Firſt to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then to his natural ſeed, &amp; then to his adopted ſeed. For God carries on all his works in a three-fold way. And as under the <hi>Law</hi> there was a door of mercy ſet open to all that would take hold of his Covenant. So under<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45720:7"/>the Goſpel there is a door of mercy ſet open to all that will take hold of the promiſe of life according as it is offered by Chriſt, of his free grace, which is in the free pardon of all their paſt ſins, upon the conditions of their love and ſincere obedience for time to come. For neither
<hi>Abraham,</hi> nor his Natural Seed, nor his adopted Seed, can any longer have a ſhare in the promiſes, than they perſiſt in their obedience; it being the condition of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his grace, that for the eternal life promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed'd, we ſhould yield him obedience. For Chriſt ſaith, Mat
16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his Croſs daily and follow me; For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it: but whoſoever will loſe his for my ſake the ſame ſhall ſave it, Luke</hi> 9.23,24,25,26. And it is the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> that is required. And what was the Faith of <hi>Abraham?</hi> The Faith of
<hi>Abraham</hi> was, that he believed <hi>God,</hi> and that was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs. <hi>And what was that which Abraham believed?</hi> That which <hi>Abraham</hi> believed was, that God would, in the way of his Obedience, make of him a great Nation, and that in him all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> calls on him to obey, and ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy Father's houſe: And I will make of thee a great Nation:</hi> Here we ſee, he was to put in practice his obedience, or elſe he could not have been heir to the promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45720:8"/>11.8. <hi>By Faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place, which he ſhould afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> So the Lord calls on us, to come out of ſin, ſelf, and the eager purſuit of this world, and to follow him, and we ſhall find reſt to our Souls, and he will give us the Crown of Life. And if we will not yield to theſe conditions, we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a ſhare in theſe promiſes. And tho' St. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of thoſe who then, upon his converſion had his iniquities forgiven, and his ſins covered, yet he ſaid, <hi>Wo be to him if he preacht not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. Whereby he ſheweth he muſt yield his obedience, or elſe vengeance would overtake him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.30. And alſo after that <hi>Abraham</hi> had been obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in leaving his Countery, and his kindred, the Lord again appeared to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. and ſaid, <hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be thou perfect.</hi> The which ſhews, God requires our continuance in our obedience to him. The which in being ſincere therein, is man's perfection.</p>
                  <p>And after God further tryed and proved <hi>Abraham</hi> whether he would obey in all things, even to that, in which the deſire of his Soul was ſet upon, which was in the offering up of his Son <hi>Iſaac:</hi> And that God commanded him to do, without a promiſe of reward, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for his willingneſs to be obedient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, God redoubled his promiſe to him. For God's<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45720:8"/>promiſes are generally attain'd and retain'd in the way of our love and obedience. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 6.16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves Servants to obey, his Servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs?</hi> By theſe words the Apoſtle puts it out of all diſpute, clearly ſhewing, that we are his Servants to whom we do yield our ſelves Servants to obey. And the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>verſe,</hi> That <hi>they were the Servants of ſin, but ye have obeyed from the heart, that form of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which was delivered you.</hi> Now the form of Doctrine was, that they ſhould obſerve all things whatſoever Chriſt had commanded. This being the laſt charge Chriſt left with his Diſciples, promiſing ſuch as did accordingly obey, that he would be with them to the end of the world,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 4.2. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by works, be hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> That is, not before God, as tho' he had by his good works, merited all thoſe great bleſſings that God had promiſed him. No, this is quite contrary to truth, and contrary to the underſtanding that ſtill remains in us, that he, or we, by our poor endeavours, when at the beſt, ſhould for them deſerve an everlaſting inheritance, and an eternal weight of glory, and that procured by the Sacrifice of the Son of his love. No, ſo to think, is an offence to God. And alſo the Lord Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45720:9"/>ye ſhall have done all thoſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, ſay, ye are unprofitable Servants,</hi> Luk. 17.10. For God needed not us, for his eternal bleſſedneſs would not have been diminiſhed if we had eternally periſhed. For he would have remained eternally bleſſed without us, altho' we ſhould have remained eternally miſerable without him. For a poor Soul before God, has no more reaſon to glory, than a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactor that a great Prince had taken pity of, &amp; therefore paid his ranſome, &amp; taken him into his Service, withal promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him as long as he kept to the Rule or way that he had ſet him, and did not wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, he would be with him to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him through all difficulties, and that, if he ſo continued to do, he would not leave him nor forſake him; and that for the ſhort time that he ſhould ſet him, if he therein was found faithful to his ſervice, he then would adopt him his Son, and give him an inheritance as a Son of his. Now, ſhould this Servant boaſt and glory before his Prince, and ſay, I think for the ſmall time of ſervice that thou requireſt of me, I deſerve all that thou haſt done, or hath promiſed to do for me; this would immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſinherit him of his Princes favour. But on the contrary, if this Servant's heart is drawn out in love and obedience to his Prince for the great kindneſs received, and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture promiſes made to him: he having a ſenſe, how infinitely above any thing that his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45720:9"/>could be, his Prince had promiſed to reward him. And therefore he reſolving to do his utmoſt endeavour, that he might be found faithful in his ſervice; he having ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and faith in his Prince, that if he was found diligent in his Service, his Lord would not only be willing, but had power according to his promiſe to reward him. His Prince alſo giving him orders that he ſhould come to him upon all occaſions for freſh ſupplies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be enabled to do him ſervice. This Servant obſerving diligently all the orders his Lord gave him, therefore at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time receives the promiſed reward. But not as tho' he had merited theſe great things, but that his great benefactor had promiſed ſuch great rewards to all his Servants that ſhould be found faithful in his Service. So Chriſt, of his free grace and mercy, hath paid the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for ſinners, for all that will yield to him their love and ſincere obedience. And at the time he takes them into his Service, he then clears them of all their paſt ſins, and for the time to come promiſes his aſſiſtance, whilſt they keep the way which he hath ſet them, and do not willingly depart from it. And if they ſhould be overtaken in a fault againſt their wills, they then ſhall not be utterly caſt down, for Chriſt remains an Advocate for them. And if they accordingly continue faithful to the death, hath promiſed then to give them the Crown of life; but not as<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45720:10"/>tho' their ſervice had merited ſo great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but that of his great mercy and rich grace he hath promiſed ſuch great rewards to all that are faithful in his Service. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, That he would be his exceeding great reward,</hi> Gen. 15.1. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewing that God would reward him for what he did, and exceedingly above what he deſerved. So Chriſt is ſaid to be the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, honour, and immortality, eternal life,</hi> Rom. 2.7. Now, tho' <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other, cannot have whereof to glory before God; yet they may rejoyce in that they have walked in ſincere obedience to him, whereby they at laſt become accepted of him, as to have the reward of the Crown of life. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever renders their ſincere obedience to God and Chriſt, comes in as an heir to the promiſe of life; For he ſhall have the righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him for his juſtification, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. whilſt others thro' their unwary walking go out of the way that God hath ſet them, whereby they fall away, and ſo loſe that Crown, which otherwiſe they might have had,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. and 2.10. And thoſe that by their wary walking have kept the way, tho' they have not to glory before God, yet for their ſo doing, they ſhall have praiſe of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. And tho' St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in the 7. <hi>v. Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45720:10"/>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17.
<hi>Every good and perfect gift cometh from above.</hi> Yet by the words of Chriſt, in the parable, it is plain, that ſome improved the Talents they had received, and ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved not their Talent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. And
<hi>Iſrael</hi> was caſt off of God for their not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their day of grace, <hi>Matthew</hi> 23.37.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 4.11,12,13. <hi>And he received the Sign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed, that he might be the father of all them that believe, tho' they be not circumciſed; that righteouſneſs might be imputed unto them alſo. And the father of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to them who are not of the Circumciſion only, but alſo walk in the ſteps of that faith of our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>which he had, being yet uncircumciſed. For the promiſe that he ſhould be the heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham,
<hi>or to his ſeed thro' the Law, but thro' the righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> Now, what was the ſteps of that Faith that our Father
<hi>Abraham</hi> walkt in, being uncircumciſed? It was, that he ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God, but believed that he ſhould have it according to the word of the Lord, in the way of his obedience, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhould be made the Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and heir of the world, which carried him thro' all difficulties, and cauſed him to tread in the ſteps of Righteouſneſs, according as the Lord required of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17,1,2.
<hi>I am the Almighty God, walk before me, and be thou<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45720:11"/>perfect. And I will make my Covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</hi> Theſe words ſhew, that God required of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> his ſincere obedience, that thereby he might be the heir of this promiſe. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, verſe 13. <hi>For the promiſe that he ſhoulld be the heir of the world, was not to</hi> Abraham,
<hi>or to his ſeed, through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith:</hi> Which was, through the righteouſneſs which this his faith produc'd; the which Circumciſion was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward given him as a Seal of this his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by faith. And whether circumciſed, or uncircumciſed, whoſoever treads in the ſteps of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> in looking for the performance of the promiſe, in the way of their obedience, ſhall alſo become heirs of life.</p>
                  <p>Rom 4.14,15,16. <hi>For if they which are of the Law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect; becauſe the Law worketh wrath; for where no Law is, there is no tranſgreſſion Therefore it is of faith, that it might be of grace; to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the Father of us all.</hi> Now the Law expected the perfect perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the thing required, before they could become juſtified by it; but then, under the Law, through mercy, they that did render their ſincere obedience thereunto, it was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45720:11"/>accepted of them, ſo as they had the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> imputed to them for their Juſtification: But hereby it ſheweth that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification was not to be attained by the Law, but, that Juſtification and Righteouſneſs is to be attained by Faith, that draws out the heart in love to God, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with an aſſent to yield obedience to him: Such are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his grace, and ſo by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> become juſtified: And where this complying frame of ſpirit is, it was, and is the ſeed, to whom the promiſe belongs, whether under the Law, or Goſpel; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as theſe, that tread in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſteps, he is a Father. For <hi>all are his ſervants, to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom.
6.16.</p>
                  <p>Rom. 4.21,22. <hi>And he being fully perſuaded, that what God hath promiſed, he was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: And therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> That is, <hi>Abraham</hi> was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that God was able to perform what he had promiſed him, which drew out his heart to yield that obedience which God required of him: He thus believing, it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs. And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 23,24,25. <hi>Now it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered for<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45720:12"/>our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> That is, if we believe in him that raiſed up our Lord from the dead, that the purchaſed Salvation by Chriſt, is to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according as he in his Word hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and ſo accordingly we lay hold of the promiſe of Life; then Chriſt was delivered for our offences, as well as for theirs; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe roſe again for our Juſtification, as well as theirs; if we (according as theſe
<hi>Romans</hi> had done to whom he wrote) <hi>have obeyed from the heart the Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> then alſo, we, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are made free from the condemning power of ſin, and are become the ſervants of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17,18. But we are no ſooner ſet clear from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of ſin, by the free grace of God, purchaſed by the Blood of his Son, but we are immediately thereupon liſted Souldiers of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> to fight under his Banner againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and all our corrupt Affections and Inclinations; <hi>and bringing down every thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5.</p>

                  <p>EPheſ. 2.8,9,10. <hi>For by Grace are ye ſaved, thro' Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: Not of works, leſt any man<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45720:12"/>ſhould boaſt. For we are his Workmanſhip, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus <hi>unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> By theſe words the Apoſtle alſo clearly ſheweth, that by good works ſtanding alone without the merits of Chriſt, no man can be juſtified in his ſight. And therefore all boaſting is taken away from man in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p>But whereas he ſaith in <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>For we are his Workmanſhip, Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Here the Apoſtle hath his peculiar reference to the firſt Churches, who were brought out of darkneſs, ſin, and errour. And as he ſaith in <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Ye were without Christ; being aliens from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael,
<hi>and ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the World.</hi> Now, at that time God did not only abound in his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them of the firſt Churches <hi>in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and prudence, Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. in ſhewing his mighty power in them, and in calling them, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>out of darkneſs into his marvelous light,</hi>
1 Pet. 2.9. and thereby bringing over the conſent of their wills to his Laws, he did then freely juſtifie them by his grace; but alſo, when God had done this for them, it was fore-ordained by him, that in good works they ſhould walk before him. Now theſe places are not fitly appliable to us;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45720:13"/>for it is evident, that we are not now in that groſs darkneſs; neither are we ſtrangers to the Covenant of Promiſe, as they were; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, as they were.</p>
                  <p>The like he ſaith of the Church, in <hi>Titus chap.</hi> 3.
<hi>v.</hi> 4,5,6,7, <hi>But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Christ our Saviour: That being justified by his grace, we ſhould be made heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the hope of Eternal Life.</hi> Now, by theſe places it is clear, that he ſpake this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them of the Then Times: For it is known to all, that there has been no ſuch abundant pourings forth of the Spirit upon the Chuches ſince the Apoſtles Times. And theſe are they of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Called of God according to his purpoſe. For, whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son,</hi> Rom. 8.28,29. According to which he ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That they ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> This he alſo ſpeaks of the Then Times, and of the Churches that firſt truſted in Chriſt, who were afore choſen of God according to his<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45720:13"/>purpoſe, which was to confirm the Truth of the Goſpel to the following Generations, and God gave to them more abundantly of his Spirit, to ſecure their ſtanding, as well as to confirm the Truth of the Goſpel; ſo as, if they did not diſinherit themſelves by wilful ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they could no ways miſs of Salvation; for they were ordained, choſen, and appointed to it of God, as
<hi>Iſrael</hi> was for the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> but neither of them was to have the fruition of that which was promiſed, without their own endeavour. Therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Save your ſelves from this untoward Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> Acts 2.40. <hi>And make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. And by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pourings forth of the Spirit upon the firſt Churches, they generally ſtood, and the major part in Scripture, is always reckoned as the whole; whereas the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> This plainly ſhews, that this Ordination was to the firſt Churches; for if all that were ordained to eternal life, then believed, it makes it clear, that to us that follow after, there remains no ſuch Ordination. According to this St.
<hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.14. Simon <hi>hath declared how God at the firſt did viſit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his Name.</hi> How a people for his Name? That is, for the greater graces here, and for the greater glory hereafter. As in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That they ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45720:14"/>firſt trusted in Christ,</hi> Epheſ. 2.7. <hi>That in the Ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards them, through Christ Jeſus.</hi> Now, at that time when God called in the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> was the time when God made his Promiſe good to
<hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they then being juſtified by the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> without the deeds of the Law; and ſo, by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they became the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and were thereby brought into ſubjection to the Commands of God, and the Moral Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 29.17
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. and ſo with <hi>Iſrael</hi> become Heirs to the Covenant of Promiſe, which Covenant of Promiſe they were before ſtrangers unto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. and at the publication of the Goſpel, was the acceptable time, and the great day of Salvation to the Gentiles, when the Lord then thus took them into Covenant with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and juſtified them freely by his grace, without the deeds of the Law; that thereby he might bring them, and their Children in as Heirs with
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. And alſo to ſhew that the Apoſtle had his chief reference to thoſe times, he ſaith, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>To wit, that God was in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</hi> And he ſaith in
<hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 1,2. <hi>We then as workers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, beſeech you alſo, that ye receive<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45720:14"/>not the grace of God in vain: For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee: Behold! now is the accepted time; Behold! now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> For then was the accepted time that free grace was freely adminiſtred, only by the change of their wills and affections, and that done by the power of God; but he beſeeches them, that they receive not the grace of God in vain; for if they wilfully again were intangled in ſin, the grace of God was received in vain by them. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt.</hi> Here he fully declareth, that in the acceptable day it was their paſt ſins were then pardoned, and afterward they were to walk in newneſs of life. And accordingly he ſaith in
<hi>verſe</hi> 26. <hi>To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs; that he might be juſt and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by clearly ſhewing, that this Juſtification had in it a chief reference to thoſe times; at which time the Apoſtle did conclude, as in <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> But when they were brought in as Heirs to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe, the caſe was altered with them; for then there was required their ſincere obedience to all God's Commands and Precepts, and therein to remain faithful to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45720:15"/>the death, if they would have the Crown of Life, by the Everlaſting Covenant ſecured to them; for then they and their Children were to retain that Doctrine which was at firſt ſo powerfully delivered,
<hi>Heb</hi> 2.1,2,3,4. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to give the more diligent heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the Words ſpoken by Angels were ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to the will of God.</hi> Thus it was the will of God ſo powerfully to confirm the Doctrine of the Goſpel. For as the outward glory was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently manifeſt at the giving of the Law; ſo the abundant pourings forth of the Spirit, with ſigns and wonders, was given for to confirm the Truth of the Goſpel. And as <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their Children were to retain the Laws of God which once they had received; ſo the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and their Children were to retain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, that had been once ſo powerfully delivered, which by the call of the Word, and the good motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, if they with diligence improved it, would make them wiſe unto Salvation: This <hi>Iſrael</hi> had, and reſiſted, for which they were<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45720:15"/>condemned, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>For as St.</hi> James ſaith, <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Whoſoever looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> And why is it called the perfect Law of Liberty? Becauſe it is an upright Rule, in which is required Man's ſincere obedience; which, when he ſincerely yields himſelf to obey, he is then by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ſet free from the condemning power of ſin and death. And whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him,</hi> John 6.44. And this is the drawing of God, his Word, and his Spirit, which we muſt be accountable for, how we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved our day and ſeaſon of grace; which ſo many thro' their ſloth and negligence miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Many are called, but few choſen,</hi> Mat. 20.16. But as to thoſe of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, that were called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23,24. <hi>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, even us whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles.</hi> Theſe were they that were called according to the fore-determined Counſel of God; for, the greater grace and ſufferings here, &amp; the greater glory hereafter; for theſe that he here ſaith were called of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſpeaks of that remnant that were called
<hi>according to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of grace,</hi> which was to remain a ſtanding Witneſs through the World, and them that<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45720:16"/>are here ſaid to be called of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were thoſe of them that firſt bore their Teſtimony to the Goſpel, which were the Churches that firſt truſted in Chriſt, theſe being prepared unto the glory, which afterwards ſhould be revealed; which preparation was for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are thoſe of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> That is, in that God choſe a remnant from among <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his Witneſſes through the World. And alſo fore-appointed the firſt Churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the determined purpoſe of his own will, that they ſhould be made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, thereby to bear their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the confirmation of the Truth of the Goſpel, to the World and ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations. So theſe being choſen according to the will of God, for the greater grace, and ſuffering here, and the greater glory hereafter, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt.</hi> And again he ſaith of the firſt Churches, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
2.7. <hi>That in the Ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And St.
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to the firſt Churches, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12.
<hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery Tryal, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you.</hi> Now, tho' theſe were not afore cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God for their fore-ſeen willing and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45720:16"/>running; yet when they were called in, they were to will and run for the prize, and ſo muſt all that will lay hold of the Crown of Life, whether Elect, or not Elect. For, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>So run, that ye may obtain.</hi> And, <hi>let us not be weary in well doing; for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not,</hi> Gal. 6.9. For though the ſtanding Witneſs or Remnant were ſo ſecured in Chriſt, as none ſhould pluck them out of his hand; for they are thoſe which are ſaid to
<hi>follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth,</hi> Rev. 14.4. yet the other Elect did not ſo ſecurely ſtand. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> warns all,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,5,6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26,29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 20. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.16. <hi>But the man that wandreth out of the way of underſtanding, ſhall remain in the Congregation of the dead.</hi> That is, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſuch as have taſted the good Word of God, and then wilfully depart from him, ſhall remain in the Congregation of the dead. But in that <hi>Solomon</hi> was forgiven; it was for the Promiſe God made to <hi>David</hi> his Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, which has now no reference to us, as I have clearly proved in another Book, where the ſtanding Witneſs is treated of, but hath another meaning than what hitherto we have apprehended of it.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32,33. <hi>And we declare unto you glad tydings, how that the promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the ſame to us their Children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again, as it is written in the ſecond</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45720:17"/>Pſalm, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> That is, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not again been raiſed from the dead, the Promiſe could never have been fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he ſaith in <hi>verſe</hi> 34. <hi>And as concerning that he raiſed him up from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he ſaid on this wiſe, I will give you the ſure mercies of</hi> David. Here the Apoſtle only repeats the words of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in that he ſaith. God will give them the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> not that the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> were then given to all that did embrace the Faith, but it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they hold out to the end, they ſhall be made partakers of thoſe ſure mercies. But at the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, was the price of that Redemption paid, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed, of which the firſt Churches had then a pledge or fore-taſt, as the earneſt of their Inheritance, in that they had <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the Holy Ghoſt ſhed on them abundantly, Titus</hi> 3.5,6. whereby they generally ſtood, and in Scripture the major part is reckoned for the whole; and alſo amongſt theſe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> was the ſtanding Witneſs, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was thus wonderfully given for the more ſecurity of their ſtanding, thereby to confirm the Truth of the Goſpel. Theſe were they that were in a more peculiar manner <hi>ordained to Eternal Life,</hi> being choſen of God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe he had before determined for them, &amp; therefore had a particular calling.<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45720:17"/>And as they had the more Talents given them, ſo they had the greater work to do, and the greater difficulties to encounter with, which they likewiſe were to perform, that were to bear their Teſtimony to the Truth againſt all the Power of the Enemy. But when the Goſpel was eſtabliſhed, thoſe that followed after, had the call of the Word, with the good motions of the Spirit of God, and the checks of Conſcience; all which improved, is able to make wiſe unto Salvation. But as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Some hear the Word, and with joy receive it, and believe for a while, yet in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fall away,</hi> Luke 8.13. This is a ſufficient proof that ſome may practically believe, and yet afterwards fall away. And others there are, that have lived a looſe life, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may fall under the terrours of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by which they may be frighted from their evil practices, after which, ſome build their faith in Chriſt, and hopes of Salvation, upon this their Converſion: But reſting there, without further improving the advantage that God puts into their hands, in turning <hi>the ſtrong man out of poſſeſſion;</hi> therefore the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant again returns, and finding them, or him empty of true love to God, and to the ways of Holineſs, and only the houſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finely garniſhed with an outward ſhew of Profeſſion, then he again takes poſſeſſion of his old Habitation with more corrupt inclinations than before, and ſo the latter end is much<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45720:18"/>worſe with ſuch than their beginning, <hi>Luke</hi>
11.21,22,24,25,26. But ſuch will be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whether they fall under a terrour or not, that keep to a cloſe walking with God in a Child-like frame of ſpirit, in love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: <hi>For he that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely,</hi> Prov. 10.9. And the Lord ſaith, <hi>God is a ſpirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> And it is only ſuch as hold out to the end, that have the ſure word of promiſe, to receive the Crown of life. But as for the very Elect, which follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, and cry day and night unto him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the oppreſſion of the Adverſary, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were deceived by the Beaſt, or falſe Prophet, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.
<hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. of which number we cannot be, becauſe all our predeceſſors came out of Popery, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we of that Remnant. But theſe are they of whom it is ſaid, <hi>the foundation ſtandeth ſure:</hi> And of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>none ſhall pluck them out of his hand.</hi> And it was to his Diſciples that were of that remnant to whom he promiſed to be with them to the end of the World: And alſo, that he will forſake none whilſt they keep to the Rule that he hath ſet before them; but the Remnant were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main his Witneſſes all the time of this World, againſt the power of this Enemy, by whom they have been often driven nto Dens and Caves of the Earth.</p>

                  <p>SAINT <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.37,38,39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, Men and Brethren, that thro' this Man is preach'd unto you the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins: And by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. This may be taken under a two-fold head, 1. That none can perform the moral Law, to that perfection as thereby to become juſtified by it, without the Merits of Chriſt. But the Apoſtle hath here his reference to the Ceremonial Law, in that he terms it the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which, in this Book, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places, he treats of the aboliſhing of. For thoſe things therein contain'd in keeping them could no ways purifie the Conſcience, but keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commands of God does purifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and thereby produces a holy life, ſo as we may with boldneſs look by the eye of Faith to Chriſt for acceptance and juſtification, thro' the imputation of his perfect Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Acts 13.26. <hi>Whoſoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you feareth God, to you is the Word of this Salvation ſent.</hi> And he ſaith, Heb. 11.6. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> For which promiſe ſake he alſo ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.7. <hi>Our twelve Tribes inſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope to come.</hi> Whereby we ſee, there was ſome of every Tribe then converted to the Chriſtian Faith. And theſe were they unto whom<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45720:19"/>St. <hi>James</hi> wrote, James
1.1. <hi>To the twelve Tribes which are ſcatered abroad, greeting.</hi> Theſe are they that are ſaid <hi>to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth,</hi> Rev. 14.4. And, of theſe it is ſaid, of every Tribe are to be ſealed <hi>twelve thouſand,</hi> Rev. 7. And all along in the word all are incouraged to run the race for the hope's ſake ſet before them, And that
<hi>they ſhall reap that faint not,</hi> Gal. Ch. 4. v. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> relating how he was ſent of the Lord to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.16. And what ſhould be the effects of his preaching, as in the 18. <hi>verſe To open their eyes and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of Sins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified by Faith that is in me.</hi> Theſe words ſhew, that until they were turned from darkneſs unto light and from the power of Satan unto God, ſo as, Satan muſt wholly loſe his ruling power in the heart, before they could receive remiſſion of their ſins, as to be ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 9.30. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? that the</hi> Gentiles <hi>which followed not after righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſneſs, even the righteouſneſs which is of Faith.</hi> That is, the firſt Churches being brought out of ſin and darkneſs by a belief in the Goſpel, and a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to yield their obedience thereunto, thereby they became juſtified thro' the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs. For a Soul-ſaving Faith,<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45720:19"/>is of a purifying quality, as knowing by the belief of the Goſpel, they are his Servants to whom they yield themſelves to obey, <hi>whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.16. And alſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of the firſt Gentile Churches, that <hi>God purified their hearts by faith,</hi> Acts 15.9. For having a faith or belief in the Doctrine of the Goſpel they were therein commanded to be <hi>holy in all manner of converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31. <hi>But Iſrael which followed after the Law of righteouſneſs, has not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Law of righteouſneſs, wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they ſtumbled at that ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone.</hi> Now the Queſtion is, what was the Law of righteouſneſs which <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and what was the works of the Law they truſted in? The Law of righteouſneſs, and works of the Law which they truſted in, was the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, with the Tithing of Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin; but they <hi>left the weightier matters of the Law undone, as judgment, mercy, and faith,</hi> Mat. 23.23,24,25,26,27. For which their evil practices they were termed, <hi>a Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> Mat.
3.7,8,9.</p>
                  <p>But whereas Chriſt ſaith of them, they had not Faith, was not only becauſe they believed not in him: but alſo becauſe they believed the word of God by halves, as to the threatnings, and mercy, which is contained in the word; which is the promiſe of Salvation to the obedient, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45720:20"/>likewiſe puniſhments to the diſobedient. But they, like us, believing the word of God by halves performed the leſſer matters of the Law, but left the weight ier undone; for which Chriſt was laid in
<hi>Zion</hi> as a ſtumbling ſtone, ſo as they ſhould not believe in him; but this their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was appointed them for their former rebellion; and the ſtroke fell upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were alike partakers with them in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                  <p>Now the Faith that had been ſo long wanting in them, was that which Chriſt in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner ſpake to: In that they believed the word of God by halves, is clear by the parable which he put forth concerning <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rich Man in his requeſt to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> to his Brethren to warn them, that they might eſcape that place of torment; but <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, They have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets let them hear them; but he ſtill perſiſted Saying, <hi>If one went to them from the dead, they would repent.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moſes
<hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the dead,</hi> Luke 16.27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby it clearly ſhews that they did not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets as they ſhould have done, ſo as to have lived a holy life.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of Chriſt, Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that thro' his Name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> That is, ſuch as believe in him according to the tenour of his Word, and<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45720:20"/>Goſpel, in which he requires our obſerving to do whatſoever he commands us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. And upon the will's conſenting to theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they received remiſſion of ſins. And whereas it is ſaid in the following <hi>verſe, While</hi> Peter <hi>ſpake theſe words, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word.</hi> Now theſe that at this time heard the word on whom the Holy Ghoſt thus ſuddenly ſell were before proſelytes of the Gentiles, who truly feared God, &amp; wrought righteouſneſs, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 34. and 35. But others that believed, of the firſt Churches, which had before lived in ſin, were to repent and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, before they could receive the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p>SAINT <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Acts 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the perſence of the Lord.</hi> By theſe words he ſheweth, that upon Repentance, and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves to Chriſt, for him to have the ruling power in the heart, at which time it is, that ſuch receive the remiſſion of their ſins; Yet their ſins, according to the text, are not blotted out, until the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord. So as if they again wilfully yield to Sin, their former treſpaſſes will again be required of them. The like the Lord ſaith in the parable, concerning the Servant that owed ten thouſand Talents, who beſought his<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45720:21"/>Lord for Pardon, and his Lord forgave him the debt. But for the Cruel uſage of his Fellow-Servant, his Lord again required his former debt, for which he delivered him to the tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, for that debt, which he had before forgiven him, <hi>Matth.</hi>
18.24,26,27,30,34.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Ezek</hi> 33.13,14,15. <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the Righteous, that he ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live: if he truſt to his own Righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, all his righteouſneſs ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, but for his iniquity that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he ſhall die for it. Again, when I ſay to the wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely die: if he turn from his ſin, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> Here we ſee that the promiſe of life is no longer to the righteous man, than he continues to do righteouſly. Neither is the threatned death to the wicked any longer than he continues to do wickedly. So likewiſe neither is the eternal life promiſed the believer of any longer continuance, than he perſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Salvation is to be had according to the tenour of the Goſpel. In which Goſpel is required, our love and ſincere obedience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> And he alſo ſaith, Mark 8.34,35. <hi>Whoſoever will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me. For whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake and the Goſpel, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it clearly ſhews that we muſt part with the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45720:21"/>delights, advantages, and pleaſures of this world, for Chriſt, as well as life it ſelf when call'd for. And Chriſt ſaith of ſome, that they receive the word with Joy, and for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord fully declares, the promiſe is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the believer than he remains believing in him and his word: Which word requires our practical obedience; The which if we perform, then are we his Diſciples indeed. For not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt Churches being in a particular manner choſen and called, unto whom the holy Ghoſt was given, whereby they generally ſtood, tho' ſome fell away by making ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. but to the ſucceeding generations of the Gentile-Churches that came in by the call of the Goſpel, with the aſſiſtance of the good motions of the Spirit of God, of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Many are called but few are choſen,</hi> becauſe of their not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of their day of grace; which God had put into their hands,

                  <head>Chap. VII. Aboliſhing the Ceremonial Law, the Yoke taken off of the Neck of the Diſciples.</head>
                  <p>ACts 15.6,7,8. <hi>And the Apoſtles and Elders came together for to conſider of this matter. And when there had been much diſputing,</hi> Peter <hi>roſe up, and ſaid unto them, Men and Brethren, ye know how that a good while ago, God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel, and believe. And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witneſs, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us.</hi> Now, whereas he ſaith, <hi>God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witneſs, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us.</hi> That is, God bare them witneſs, that this belief in them, was according to the tenour of the Goſpel; and therefore God gave to the firſt Gentile-Churches the Holy Ghoſt, as he did to the believing Jews. And therefore he ſaith in the 9th <hi>verſe. And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith.</hi> Here we ſee, that by this Faith their hearts were purified in their believing the mercy was not to be received, nor retained without a complying frame of ſpirit to the will of God, in yielding their obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which requires our love to God, and his Commands.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he ſaith in <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a Yoke upon the neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</hi> This Yoke which he here ſpeaks of, was Circumciſion, Sacrifices, and often Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45720:23"/>and Purifications, which were very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, and not profitable; for, <hi>they could no ways make the comers thereunto perfect.</hi> But Faith in Jeſus Chriſt begets a holy life: For in the believing that Chriſt is become the Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. The belief of this, makes Faith a purifying Faith. But whereas the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Acts</hi> 15.11. <hi>But we believe that through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved, even as they.</hi> That is, the Believers of the Jews that were Circumciſed, which had yielded their obedience unto Chriſt, did alike believe, that through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhould be ſaved, even as the Believers of the Gentiles that had embraced the Faith, in yielding their conſent to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Goſpel. For, as the Believers of the Gentiles were ſaved through the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without Circumciſion, and the Ceremonial Law: So the Believers of the Jews, did alſo believe that they might be ſaved without them, as well as the Gentiles. But as for the Moral Law, we are as much obliged to keep it, as ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> was,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For, not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> By theſe words, Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> declares, that the Moral Law was in as full force as ever it was. But as for the Ceremonial Law, which afterwards was termed the Law of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> about which was this Contention, it being then to be aboliſhed. This is further treated of, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. <hi>They are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45720:23"/>informed of thee, that thou teacheſt all the Jews which are among the Gentiles, to forſake</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they ought not to Circumciſe their Children, neither to walk after their Cuſtoms.</hi> And ſo in <hi>v.</hi> 23,24. of the ſame chapter, it is to the like effect.</p>

<hi>That ye preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth to his neighbour,</hi> Gal. 6.7,8,9. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. For he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the ſleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting. Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we ſhall reap, if we faint not.

<hi>The fruits of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance; againſt ſuch there is no Law. And they that are in Chriſt, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi> Now, tho' there was no Law to condemn ſuch; yet there was the Law of God to guide them. And of ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle ſpake, when he ſaid, <hi>They were not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> The like he ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.</hi> That is, not under the condemning power of the Law. For ſuch as be led by the Spirit, yield their ſincere obedience to the Moral Law. Accordingly he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> And alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and Uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping the Commands of God.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.3. <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments.</hi> And alſo in <hi>John</hi> 14.15.
<hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> By all this, we ſee, we are as much obliged to keep the Moral Law, as ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> was. But, whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight; for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin.</hi> That is, by the Law we are all ſenſible that we do not live up to it, as thereby to become juſtified by it; and therefore, by it, all have<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45720:25"/>knowledge that they ſin; for hone can live up to that perfection, as to become juſtified by it, without the merits of Chriſt. But when
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did walk blameleſly in it, according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in which God had put them, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt was imputed for their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And of <hi>Zechariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. <hi>They were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commands and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> So, if we render our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience to all God's Commands and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, we may then look to Chriſt with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for our Juſtification. For, tho' the Churches that firſt truſted in Chriſt were ſaved without the deeds of the Law, or viſible works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, yet, not without an inward work, which was in the change of their wills and affections, as being the foundation to all good works, which afterward they accordingly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, all that remained ſtedfaſt in the Faith. And alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives charge that they ſhould be <hi>rich in good works,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.18,19.
<hi>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> By theſe words, he fully declareth, that good works are a foundation for us to build our hopes of Salvation upon, as well as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt; for it is a conditional Covenant. And alſo from theſe words of the Apoſtle, we are to take notice, there is another time to <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45720:25"/>come before Eternity, in which the Saints will be bleſſed. And he ſaith,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him: for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> This is the Faith that ſtirs us up to all good works, whereby we come in as Heirs to the promiſed mercy. For Chriſt <hi>is the Author of eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>Who will render to every man according to his deeds.

And whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If he had all Faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.23. That is, Faith in God, and in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, with a belief alſo, that good works are required; and he knowing God. And therefore, if he did them not in love to God, and love to his Neighbour, it would profit him nothing; for it is <hi>we</hi> have turned this Word into Charity, which in the Original is Love. But this he ſpeaks, to ſhew, that God requires our Love in all our actions. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he ſaith, <hi>It is a faith that worketh by love, which is required,</hi> Gal. 5.6. And there is no ſuch obedience as that wherein the heart is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. But as for them that know not God, and therefore love him not, they ſhall alſo be judged according to their works. So the Believers will be judged according to their actions, done with their affections. For it is not only our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication will ſtand us in ſtead, but how we have believed in Chriſt as to obey the Doctrine of Chriſt, which will make us bleſſed in that day Whereby we ſee, that tho' the Gentiles were at firſt called in, and juſtified by his grace, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards all that were not immediately after their Converſion taken away by death, were to be judged according to their deeds done in the body from the time of Converſion. For Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to the Church, <hi>If ye call ou the Father
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45720:26"/>who without reſpect of perſons judgeth according to every man's work, paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. That is, the Believers will be judged according to their deeds, from the time they were brought into the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; and others, how they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their day and ſeaſon of grace, in refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is evil, and in ordering their converſation according to the Goſpel. So all will be judged according to their deeds done in their body, whether they have been good or evil: For, though we can do nothing of our ſelves without God's aſſiſtance; yet it is required of us to improve the advantages and ſeaſons of grace which he giveth us, and to take to the Way and Rule that he hath ſet before us, in which way he hath promiſed his aſſiſtance; and it is ſuch will be bleſſed.</p>

                  <p>1 JOHN 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him.</hi> Now we muſt always look to the words that go before, and to thoſe that follow after, if we would come to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word. For in that he ſaith, They that love God, they likewiſe love Chriſt that is begotten of him, or elſe they cannot be born of God: For if they, or we, are not by our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Chriſt is the Son of God, brought off from the delights of this World, we cannot be born of God: For it is ſuch a belief in us, that Chriſt is the Son of God, which draws out our heart to love and obey him as God; or elſe our belief in him is not ſuch as makes us to be born of God. Therefore he ſaith in <hi>verſe</hi>
2. <hi>By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we love God, &amp; keep his Commandments.</hi> For by the Commandments of God, we are commanded<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45720:28"/>to love the Children of God; and by keeping the commands of God, it is we know that we love God; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> By which we ſee, our love to God and Chriſt, is in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Commands. And he ſaith in
<hi>verſe</hi> 4. <hi>For whatſoever is born of God overcometh the World: and this is the victory that overcometh the World, even our faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What meaneth the Apoſtle here, in ſaying, that by faith they overcame the World: He meaneth all the vain, fleſhly, and covetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of any thing relating to the World, which by their faith they overcame. Which faith, ſet them on work, looking for the reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, which is the Crown of Life. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſome have again been overcome by the World, and ſo <hi>made ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. and others, as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18,19. They
<hi>allure thro' the luſt of the fleſh, thro' much wantonneſs, thoſe that were clean eſcaped from them, who live in errour: While they promiſe them liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which nothing can be more plain, than that thoſe that have had the New Birth wrought in them, and have overcome the World, may again be overcome by the World, and brought into bondage, and ſo <hi>the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning,</hi> as in <hi>ver.</hi> 20,21. Now
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45720:29"/>the man that is born of God, is brought off from the World, and whilſt he ſo continues new-born, or brought off from the World, <hi>he ſinneth not,</hi> becauſe he doth not wilfully commit ſin.

                  <p>John 5.16. <hi>If any man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death.</hi> Now, were there none but thoſe that were ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely choſen of God, that they could not fall away, it could not then be ſo properly ſaid of them, that prayers ſhould give them life, that never were in danger of death. And ſo, on the contrary, if others by the determinate Counſel of God, were left under a neceſſity of damnation, then prayers for ſuch would be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>available, it being impoſſible that the offender ſhould receive life by them; neither would the Apoſtle have given orders for them to have been ſo prayed for.</p>

<hi>We know, that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> Theſe words admit of a two-fold meaning: Firſt, That there was a remnant of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo ſecured in Chriſt, as<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45720:29"/>they could not be deceived. Secondly, They have a reference to all that that are born of God, ſo as to be brought off from the ways of ſin: And whilſt they are thus born, or brought off from ſin, ſo as to maintain a continual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil: Such an one the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now we are to take notice, that by their improving their ſeaſon of grace, or the Talents which God had given them; the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They kept</hi> themſelves, <hi>ſo as the evil one toucheth them not.</hi> For they which had the five Talents, were to improve them, as well as they which had the two, and one. But whoſoever is again brought off from the ways of God, to the World, as to yield themſelves again ſervants to ſin, the grace of God was by them received in vain. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith; <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3,4. <hi>And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.

                  <p>JOHN 3.1,2,3. <hi>There was a man of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, named</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>a Ruler of the Jews: the ſame came to Jeſus by night, and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do theſe Miracles that thou doeſt, except God be with him. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> This the Lord ſaid to a man that was a Phariſee, and a Ruler in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and to a man that had a deſire after the knowledge of the Lord; but was aſhamed to come to him in the ſight of the World; and ſo came to Jeſus by night; and therefore the Lord ſaid unto him, as in the foregoing words; in which the Lord had only his reference to ſuch as were aſhamed to own him before men, and ſuch as live after the fleſh. Now, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> wondering at the anſwer of the Lord, in <hi>verſe</hi> 4. ſaid unto him,
<hi>How can a man be born when he is old? can he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond time into his Mothers womb and be born? ver.</hi> 5,6 Jeſus anſwered, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit.</hi> Theſe words of the Lord here, has no reference to Children, as to their thus being born again, nor to thoſe perſons that have always lived in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and upright converſation. For, firſt, the<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45720:30"/>Believers Children are in Covenant, and if they die in their Infancy, are accepted in and thro' Chriſt. And <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was moved by the Spirit of God with joy in his Mothers womb, upon the ſalutation of the bleſſed Virgin. And Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Mark 10.14. Therefore what is here ſpoken by the Lord, of being born after the fleſh, hath not its reference to the natural birth. But as the Lord had a figurative meaning, in ſaying, they muſt be born after the Spirit, or they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. So the Lord hath here a figurative meaning as to theſe here ſpoken of, which are born of the fleſh: That is, thoſe that embraced the deſires of the fleſh, and the world, and thereby begotten or born of it, from which they muſt be again new born, that is, brought off by forſaking that, which before they delighted in, and their wills and affections brought into a complying frame to the Spirit of God, or they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> 3.8. The Lord ſaith, <hi>The Wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but thou canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> By theſe words the Lord doth ſeem to have a reference in the firſt place to them that were in a peculiar manner choſen and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to partake of the Holy Ghoſt; and alſo theſe words have a reference in general to all to whom<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45720:31"/>the Word of the Goſpel ſhould come, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the good motions of the Spirit of God, as thereby to be brought off from ſin.

<hi>The Spirit that dwelleth with you, ſhall be in you,</hi> John 14.17. becauſe, unto them was given the Holy Ghoſt to be in them, which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45720:31"/>afterward alſo was but with the Churches. But Chriſt in every true Believer, muſt be ſo in them, as to have the ruling-power in their hearts and affections, in that their wills muſt be brought into ſubjection unto Chriſt, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying frame of ſpirit to his will. And thus Chriſt dwells in every true Believer: For, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in Chriſt, in them is required a mind agreeable to the will of Chriſt, that he thereby may rule in the heart.

But
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God had taken into Covenant with himſelf, they likewiſe were termed Reprobates for their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſobedience; for which they were rejected of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.28,30. <hi>They are all grievous

                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12,13. <hi>It is God that worketh in them both to will and to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own good pleaſure.</hi> That is, it was ſo far the good will and pleaſure of God, to reſtore them, and renew them by his Spirit, and to put them into a capacity of ſincere obedience; in which capacity they were to uſe their utmoſt diligence to <hi>work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> So likewiſe are we to do the ſame alſo: For thoſe that received the Talents, were to improve that which was given them; and he that did not according to his ability im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that which he had received, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.15.</p>

                  <head>Chap. XVI. A Believer not coming into Condemnation, explained.</head>
                  <p>CHriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but is paſſed from death unto life</hi> Theſe words of the Lord may admit of a two-fold meaning: That is, whilſt the Believer continues believing, that Salvation is to be had, according to the promiſe of the Lord in the Goſpel, in the way of their love and obedience. Whilſt he thus believeth, he ſhall never come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. But this which the Lord here ſaith, hath its peculiar reference to his ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which time he cometh to judge the world, and reſtore all things, as in <hi>verſe</hi> 22. The Judgment is then committed unto Chriſt, at which time, as in <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>All men ſhall honour the Son, as they honour the Father.</hi> The which, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet hath been done; for the generality of the Jews hitherto, have not honoured the Son, as they honour the Father. Neither by the Turks is the Son honoured as the Father. Therefore, this the Lord ſpake for the time when he again ſhall come: That whoſoever he ſhall then find a true practical Believer, ſhall not come into condemnation.</p>
                  <p>For then the everlaſting life that is now given the Believer, will be ſecured to their perſons; for at that time they will be put into a capacity never more to offend: For not only the raiſed Saints, but the living Believer will then receive<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45720:33"/>the Crown of Life. For when the Lord again cometh, the Crown of Righteouſneſs is given to all that love his appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. For when an inherent perfect Righteouſneſs is given, and the continuance of it ſecured to us, by the eſtabliſhing of the now-promiſed, new, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, then is Life crowned to the Soul. This is the Covenant of Promiſe, which now the Believers with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are but Heirs to. <hi>And if ye be Chriſt's then are ye</hi> Abraham<hi>'s ſeed, and Heirs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3.29. but when the Lord again comes, his other Sheep will be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Fold, with them that do ſecurely ſtand. For the Lord ſaith, At that time <hi>when there is one Fold, there ſhall be but one Shepherd,</hi> John 10.16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this will not be till the Lord again comes.</p>
                  <p>But we, taking all the Promiſes as relating to us, and the preſent time, has occaſioned our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into great miſtakes. For, whereas the Lord ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.20. <hi>If ye have faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay to this Mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhall be unpoſſible unto you.</hi> Now, tho' at that time the Diſciples faith was but weak, yet afterwards, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Lord, they did greater Miracles, than that of removing Mountains; but this promiſe belongs no more to us, than that, of ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But, as much as we can do the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ſo much the Promiſe belongs to us. Likewiſe the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Gentiles<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45720:34"/>which had received the Holy Ghoſt, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 2,3. <hi>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto theſe dumb Idols, even as you were led. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give you to underſtand, that no man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed: and that no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now he ſpake this of thoſe that were convinced by the Holy Ghoſt, that Chriſt was the Son of God. For the others that were not then thus convinced, would not own him. But now all the Chriſtians have learned by rote, to ſay that Chriſt is the Son of God, without the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the perſons of the firſt Churches were in a more particular manner choſen to be Heirs to the promiſed everlaſting Covenant, becauſe unto them was given the Holy Ghoſt, as the earneſt of their Inheritance, ſo as they muſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſinherit themſelves, if they miſt of the promiſed bleſſedneſs; but to the ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of the Gentile Churches, to them the Promiſes belonged, as they before did to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And tho' they were not given the Holy Spirit to be in them, as he was in the firſt Churches, but to be with them, as he was with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet none can come in as Heirs to the promiſed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without bringing their wills and affections into ſubjection unto Chriſt; for he muſt be ſo in them, as to have the ruling-power in the heart; for <hi>he that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. That is, ſo as to have their minds brought into ſubjection to the will of<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45720:34"/>Chriſt. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13,14. <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye thro' the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God.</hi> That is, whoſoever will not be led by the Spirit of God, to obey the revealed Will of God, are not the Sons of God. Therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he related who they were, that were in Covenant, he there declares, it is the Believer that is in Covenant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith; <hi>If one of the Parents be a Believer, then are the Children holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. Whereby we ſee, all that come in as Heirs to the Covenant, are included as Believers. And the Believer is no longer a Believer, than he believes Salvation is to be had according to the tenour of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But when the Everlaſting Covenant is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed together, the which will be at the Reſurrection of the Juſt, which is at the reſtitution of all things; then it is, that God will never turn away from them, neither ſhall they then any more depart from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. God ſaith, <hi>I will make an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> This is that which crowns life to the Soul. This promiſe is not only to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to all the adopted Seed that ſhall be found true Believers in that day; then it is that the Lord will perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45720:35"/>as in the 39th. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them and their Children after them.</hi> This is clearly evident, that this promiſe was never made good to the Children of the Gentile Churches, and therefore this promiſe remains to be made good in time to come; <hi>for his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot fail; for, hath he ſaid it, and ſhall he not do it? no, let God be true, and every man a lyar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were firſt brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant, then was the time when God ſaw them in their ſin, and ſaid unto them, live: For when God brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were then polluted in their blood; the which time, was the time of love; the Lord then taking them into Covenant with himſelf, and thereby he ſaid unto them,
<hi>live.</hi> But <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not obeying the voice of the Lord, in living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Commands and Precepts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were caſt off of God. So when God firſt took into Covenant the Tranſgreſſors of the Gentiles, they were then polluted in their blood; whom God then renewed by his Spirit, and took them into Covenant with himſelf, and put them into a capacity of obedience. And the Believers Children were ſharers in the promiſed Mercy, until ſuch time as they grew to have no love to the truth, but, like <hi>Iſrael,</hi> took pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs: Then God left them to ſtrong deluſions, that they might believe lyes: That all might be damned who believe not the truth, <hi>but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:45720:35"/>But God hath promiſed all to be with them, whilſt they keep the way; and to the remnant, of whom the Diſciples ſprang, which were his Fathers before, and given to Chriſt, it was thoſe of whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>None ſhall pluck them out of my hand;</hi> but that <hi>he would be with them to the end of the World.</hi> Now when Chriſt firſt came, the Spirit was ſhed on Believers abundantly, <hi>Titus</hi>
3.6. Yet notwithſtanding St. <hi>Paul</hi> terms it but night, to that approaching day which is at hand; and therefore ſaith, <hi>The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, let us walk honeſtly as in the day,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12,12. Thereby ſhewing, that in that day there will be no diſorderly walking amongſt them; for then it is, that both the natural, and adopted Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> will be all taught of God, from the leaſt of them, to the greateſt of them; ſo as they ſhall no more teach every man his Neighbour, and his Brother. For then it is, <hi>The knowledge of the Lord ſhall cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> I ſhall not here inſiſt upon the Everlaſting Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I intend fully to explain it in another Treatiſe.</p>

                  <head>Chap. XVI. A Belief in Chriſt further Explained.</head>
                  <p>NOW whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me,</hi> or on me, <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And the Apoſtles alſo, Saying, <hi>He that Believeth in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Which is no other, than in ſhort to declare, that Chriſt had ſaid, and manifeſted the way and method of Salvation:<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45720:36"/>which if accordingly be lieved, they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Therefore Chriſt ſaith to the Church,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt and repent. If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</hi> Here we ſee the Lord calls upon them to put in practice what they have heard. Which if they do not, he will come upon them at an hour they are not aware of. And as the Thief comes to deſtroy, ſo the Lord will come to the deſtruction of them that have his word, and will not according thereunto wait for him, with a prepared heart in love to receive him. For he ſaith,
<hi>If ye keep my Commandments ye ſhall abide in my love,</hi> John 15.10. and in the 14. <hi>v. Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> And alſo the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 8.31. <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed.</hi> And the offer of mercy by
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> is to all that will take his Yoke upon them, <hi>Matth.</hi>
11.29. And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34,35,36. <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow me. For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it, but whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake and the Goſpel, the ſame ſhall ſave it. For what ſhall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul.</hi> This loſing of the life for Chriſt, is to be taken under a twofold head. Not only when we are called to lay down our life for the defence of the Goſpel; but alſo in denying our ſelves the pleaſures, delights, and<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45720:36"/>advantages of this world, for this is ſpoken in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to all that will ſave their lives to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. According to this the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 12.25. <hi>He that loveth his life, ſhall loſe it, and he that hateth his life in this world, ſhall keep it unto life eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Matth. 7.24. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, is like to a wiſe man, that built his houſe upon a rock.</hi> So if we lay hold upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life according to the conditions offered by Chriſt, we build upon that rock that will never fail us. So as when the greateſt ſtorm ariſeth, that man will ſecurely ſtand; becauſe
<hi>he is faithful that hath promiſed.</hi> But if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt for juſtification, yet walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our own imaginations, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Commands, it is building upon a ſandy foundation, for which they will have dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. According to the word of the Lord, when he ſent his Diſciples to teach the Doctrine of the Goſpel: which was the conditions of the Covenant of grace. He then ſaid, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.15,16. That is, it was the Goſpel which then Chriſt ſent forth his diſciples to teach, which they that heard, were to believe. Accordingly the Lord ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19,20. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45720:37"/>baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all things whatſoever I command you: and lo, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> That is, with the race of the Diſciples, which is of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he will be with to the end of the World; for they are thoſe that none can pluck out of his hand. And of whom it is ſaid, they follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth. And alſo he will never forſake any whilſt they keep his way, in obſerving to do whatſoever he Commands them.</p>
                  <p>Now the Belief in Chriſt that is ſaving, is to be grounded upon the words of Chriſt, that his righteouſneſs is to be applied for the juſtification of the ſinner, according to the conditions as it is tendred by him, which is in the obſerving to do whatſoever he commanded them. For tho' at the firſt receiving of the Goſpel, by his free grace, they were ſaved from their ſins, by yielding to the conditions that Chriſt required. Yet all of them, that were not immediately taken away by death, were to be judged according to the performance of thoſe conditions, before they could be thought meet to partake of the Crown of life. And in every believer, is required <hi>the faith of God's Elect,</hi> that in the way of their love and obedience, they ſhall become Heirs to the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zacheus</hi> deſired to be a Diſciple of the Lord, and he knew, in being ſo, his Obedience was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Therefore he ſaid,
<hi>Lord, half of my goods<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45720:37"/>I give to the poor: and if I have taken any thing from any, by falſe accuſation, I will reſtore him fourfold,</hi> Luke 19.8. But many of us, like the Jews of old, by their Tradition, made the Commands of God of no effect. So many with us, by their half-faith, or believing but half way, in that they leave out the conditions, upon which life and ſalvation is offered by Chriſt, have made their faith in Chriſt of none effect to the ſaving of their Souls, becauſe the promiſe of life is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of our Obedience: In which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever remains faithful to the death, ſhall have the Crown of life. But for any to think that Chriſt dyed to give them a liberty to ſin, it is of ſuch God ſaith, <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes. Now conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver,</hi> Pſal. 50.21,22. This forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God, is forgetting their duty, as to yield Obedience unto his Commands.</p>
                  <p>But for our having Faith in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, ſeparate from good works, is dead, ſtanding alone, <hi>James</hi>
2.20,21,22. <hi>But wilt thou know, vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham, our Father, juſtified by works, when he had offered Iſaac his Son upon the Altar? Seeſt thou how faith wrought with his work, and by works was faith made perfect.</hi> Thereby ſhewing that a lively and perfect Faith, always includs good works. As firſt the inward work upon the will and affections; and afterwards good works put<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45720:38"/>in practiſe. Therefore he ſaith in the 26 verſe, <hi>For as the body without the Spirit is dead, ſo faith without works is dead alſo.</hi> And Chap 1. <hi>v.</hi>
25. <hi>But whoſo looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> Now why is it term'd the Law of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Becauſe ſuch as walk in obedience thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are by Chriſt ſet free from the condemning power of ſin and death, 26. <hi>v. If any man among you ſeem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's Religion is vain.</hi> v. 27. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their affliction, and to keep themſelves unſpotted from the world.</hi> Here we ſee St. <hi>James,</hi> as well as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> finds ſome that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take up with an imaginary faith, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned through the miſtake of ſome of the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of St
<hi>Paul.</hi> Altho, the ſame Apoſtle in ſuch abundance of places doth ſo clearly explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by ſhewing what is required of them that are to be made partakers of the Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as has been already proved. And he alſo ſheweth, that good works is a foundation for us to build our hopes of Salvation upon, as well as the merits of Chriſt, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17,18,19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And he alſo ſaith, <hi>It is not the hearers of the Law are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified,</hi> Rom. 2.13. And that we ſhould <hi>give our Bodies a living Sacrifice which is our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervice,</hi> Rom. 12.1. And alſo that we<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45720:38"/>muſt maintain a continual warfare, <hi>Eph.</hi>
6.11,12,13. And as we believe that God is, ſo we are to believe that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Now in all theſe places in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes plainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the word of God and Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles, we will not believe him in, becauſe they do not ſo well ſuit our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But in thoſe ſayings of his, which we have not underſtood him in, we have placed our belief, to the contradiction of himſelf, and all the revealed will of God in his word. And tho' St. <hi>Peter</hi> did forewarn us, that in St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles there were ſome things hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; which then, ſome did wreſt to their own deſtruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3.16. Yet we have not thereby taken warning, but how we ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it before the great Judge, which is juſt at hand, we had need now to conſider before it be too late.</p>
                  <p>Now the Churches that firſt truſted in Chriſt, being more Eminently choſen and called of God, and by the abundant ſhedding forth of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt upon them, they generally ſtood. But the following generations were but raiſed to that from which <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell. And therefore, by their miſcarriage, we had need take warning. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee,</hi> Rom. 11.21. And Oh! that it might be a ſufficient warning to us.</p>

                  <p>SAINT <hi>John</hi> ſaith, Chap. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> This St. <hi>John</hi> ſpake of them that heard <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and believed not on him. The like the Lord ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the 18 verſe,
<hi>He that believeth on me, is not condemned, but he that believed not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotton Son of God.</hi> By theſe words it is plain, that thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, were thoſe that refuſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. And not that thoſe were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for not believing in him, who never heard of him. For if ſo, the Lord had then excluded all the firſt Churches, who were then to be brought home by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But we have falſly imagined from theſe, and the like words, as where the Lord ſaid to his Diſciples, Mark 16.15,16. <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature. He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Which words has only a reference to ſuch as believed, and ſuch as refuſed believing, ſo as not to yield o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the truth when they heard it. For according to the Commands of the Lord, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. The Goſpel <hi>was preached to every Creature which is under heaven,</hi> Col. 1.23. Now the Children did not fall under this condemnation,<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45720:39"/>becauſe they were not capable of believing, or not believing. Neither do the Heathen now fall under this condemnation, who know not the Goſpel. For none ſhall be damned, for not believing that they never heard.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</hi> Theſe words do not exclude them that never heard of the Son, ſo as none of them ſhall never receive life by the Son. For there will be a Redemption in the world to come, as will be fully proved in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treatiſe. And when Chriſt comes to judge the world, and at the laſt and final Judgment, they are all ſaid to be judged according to their deeds done in the Body, whether they have been good, or evil. And tho' in the parable of the Sheep and Goats, there is but two ſorts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet there is a third included: in as much, as the poor, and the Children, were not capable to be made partakers of the bleſſing, or the curſe in their doing, or not doing good to the diſtreſſed Sheep of Chriſt. And therefore the word
<hi>all</hi> is not mentioned, when he ſentenced them to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. And whereas Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>To take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.5,6,7,8,9. The word <hi>all</hi> he mentions not. But he includes them that have the knowledge of God, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, yet in works deny him, in that they will <pb n="74" facs="tcp:45720:40"/>not yield obedience to him. And the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 3.19.
<hi>That what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law.</hi> So likewiſe, what the Goſpel ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the Goſpel. That is to them that have the Goſpel, and obey or refuſe to obey the ſame. To them accordingly doth the promiſed mercy, or the threatned judgment belong. And in the Goſpel is required our obedience to the Moral Law. And alſo he ſaith, Rom. 2.11,12. <hi>There is no reſpect of perſons with God. For as many as have ſinned without the Law, ſhall alſo periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law: and as many as have ſinned in the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law.</hi> By which we ſee, the Heathens that have not the knowledge of God, come not under the ſame Judgment, or condemnation, of the fiery indignation, unto which the wicked Chriſtians are condemned, becauſe the law and Goſpel only ſpeaks to them that are under it. Neither did the Old world go into the fire of Hell. And all being judged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works, and according to their deeds done in the body, whether they have been good or evil. Therefore to them that has done no evil works, there will be a general releaſe when they are judged. Therefore all Children will certainly be cleared. Neither do all offenders fall under everlaſting condemnation. The which by God's aſſiſtance, I ſhall further prove in a Treatiſe concerning forgiveneſs in the world to come. But as for thoſe Gentiles of old, ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2.14,15,16. <hi>Which having not the<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45720:40"/>Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law; theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves: Which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing one another. In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel.</hi> And the Goſpel ſaith, that all ſhall be judged according to their deeds. Now Conſcience is a true witneſs, which God hath ſet up in the Soul; therefore whom that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth in judgment, thoſe will find mercy, as by the Apoſtles foregoing words, he doth fully make appear. But as for all the Heathen, whom we have miſtakenly thought went to everlaſting fire, by the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we have not been permitted to judge them, but to leave them to the judgment of the all-wiſe God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12,13. For God hath ſecret places for Souls, in that great pit, which we know not of. And ſome goes to the water, and ſome to the fire, and ſome to priſon-houſes. As will be proved.</p>
                  <p>But to him that ordereth his converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, God hath promiſed to ſhew his Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 350.2. And the Lord alſo ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted. Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3,4,5,6,7,8,9. And God hath promiſed he will give grace and glory to them that walk uprightly, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84.11. And the like God ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.15,16. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 15. and <hi>Pſ.</hi>

He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, who hath not lift up his ſoul to vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully. He ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs from the God of his Salvation.</hi> This is the man that is ſure to have the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him from the God of his Salvation. And by an upright converſation, in complyance to a chief good, the Noble Heathen gropt after Chriſt in the dark. And when all are judged according to their works, they then of a certain ſhall have their Reward, Rev. 22.12. <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be;</hi> and ch. 20.12,13. ch.

                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> had no other meaning, for the word

                  <p>I Have in the fore-mentioned Book by the word fully proved what is meant by being Choſen from the foundation of the world. And alſo proved, that in the word there is mention made of three evers, three times, three genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, three worlds; and that there was none choſen before the foundation of the material Heavens and Earth. That theſe three worlds ſpoken of in Scripture, are three worlds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

<hi>Aegypt,</hi> and laid them for the foundation of the world to come. For all that comes in Heirs to that world, comes in as the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from the foundation of which world, was Chriſt figuratively ſlain in the Paſchal Lamb. And from that foundation of the world, was the works of thoſe unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews finiſhed; when they thro' their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, refuſed to go to fight for the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> therefore were condemned to die in the wilderneſs from 20 years old and upward, ſave <hi>Caleb,</hi> and
<hi>Joſhua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then after this miſcarriage, God elected, and ſecured a remnant in Chriſt of that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45720:43"/>which was then a laying in <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the world to come.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s miſcarriage, God did likewiſe elect, and make choice of the firſt Gentile Churches to partake of the Holy Ghoſt, and God choſe them before the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were the foundation of the world to come. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, They were choſen in Chriſt before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world; That is, before the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were the foundation of the World to come. And this not as to matter of time, but as to matter of choice, and liking in God, rather to appoint and make choice of them that ignorantly offend him, to call them in by a particular calling, and give to them, with the remnant the Holy Ghoſt, that they thereby might bear their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the world of the truth of the Goſpel, rather than thoſe of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> that did wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, and would not be a light to the world. All theſe things are fully, and clearly proved in the other Treatiſe, with the hardning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart. And what it was God hardned him in.</p>

                  <p>This he does not only ſpeak of them that had the peculiar calling, as the remnant choſen from among <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the firſt Gentile Churches, which were likewiſe choſen to bear their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the truth. But theſe words had alſo a reference to all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> who were all called, and unto whom the promiſes belong'd, and to their Children. So the promiſes belonged to them that were called of the Gentile Churches, and their Children. And unto all to whom the word of God ſhall come, accompanied with the good motions of the Spirit of God; to them likewiſe does the promiſe of the Eternal Inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, if they according to the condition, as it is tendred, will lay hold of it. And whoſoever continues faithful, ſhall, at the end, have the fruition of the eternal inheritance that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed upon thoſe conditions, <hi>Acts</hi>
10.35. <hi>For in every Nation, he that feareth God, and worketh

And when the Gentile Nations were called in, it was then God made good his word to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then did the promiſe belong to them, and their Children, as it did to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their Children. So as they might receive the promiſe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inheritance upon the conditions offered. Now the firſt Gentile Churches were not only called, that they might receive the promiſe of the Eternal Inheritance, but they had alſo the Holy Ghoſt given to them, as the earneſt of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which afterwards they ſhould receive, if they did not diſinherit themſelves. And to their Children that followed after them, did the promiſe of the Eternal Inheritance belong. But at the time that any Nation or people have not the Goſpel, at that time they have not the call. At which time, the promiſe of Eternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance belongs not to them. Yet they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all mercy. But where the word of God is, as the call thereof is rightly underſtood, there it is, where the eternal Life may be laid hold on. But ſuch as by often ſinning have cauſed God to withdraw the good motions of his Spirit from them, they are thereby left to blindneſs of mind.

<hi>Tim.</hi> 4 7,8. Neither was the Crown of life, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe promiſed.

                  <p>ST. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47.
<hi>And the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> This he ſaid to the Jews, becauſe the generality of them were excluded the then mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo that ſuch of them as were not left to blindneſs were daily added to the Church. For Chriſt, in <hi>Zion,</hi> was laid as a ſtumbling ſtone. And as for thoſe Gentiles that were ordained to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45720:46"/>eternal Life, they were called in by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing power of the Spirit, which went with the word of the Diſciples, whereby they did yield their aſſent to be obedient to the truth, which they no ſooner did, but God juſtified them by his grace, and glorified them by his giving to them the Holy Ghoſt to be in them, whereby he did abound to them in all wiſdom and prudence, and in divers miracles, and gifts. This is that in which God did manifeſt himſelf to them, as he did not unto the world. Theſe are they which Chriſt prayed for with his Diſciples, that ſhould believe in him thro' their word. Which was by the word preached by the mouth of the Diſciples, by whom the firſt Churches were gathered. For the word of God, and Chriſt, was never term'd the word of the Diſciples. But the firſt Churches receiving the word from the mouth of the Diſciples, therefore ſaid by Chriſt, <hi>to believe in him thro' their word.</hi> But when the Holy Ghoſt was ſhed forth abundantly on the firſt Churches, then the Holy Ghoſt became an evident witneſs to the world that God had ſent Chriſt. So as the world did not believe thro' the Word of the Diſciples, but through the convincing ſigns and wonders, and mighty power of the Spirit of God that was ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Churches. The which did bear witneſs, it was the word of God that was taught amongſt them. For had we had no other witneſs than the word of a few Diſciples, that Chriſt was the Son of God, there had been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45720:46"/>reaſon for the world to have believed it. But the viſible witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt, bearing witneſs to the truth of what the Diſciples taught, was the convincing argument to the world, that God had ſent Chriſt, as thereby they might take hold of the offered mercy by him, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as it is tendred. And if we are found in our duty, according to the capacity God has put us in, we then ſhall not want his aſſiſtance to enable us to do that which he requires of us. But as for the Diſciples, and firſt Churches, Chriſt in a particular manner prayed for, as he did not for the world, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they all may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Now, whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>that they may be one in us.</hi> That was, in that they were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, which both them that were firſt given to Chriſt of the Father, and the firſt Churches that ſhould believe in him thro' their word received from the mouth of the Diſciples, were alſo partakers of that one Spirit with God and Chriſt, and thereby became one with them, in being united by one Spirit. For the Spirit that was before with the Diſciples, was given to be in them, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. <hi>That they ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory who firſt truſted in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.12.</p>
                  <p>And this was evident to the world when the Holy Ghoſt was thus given. And the Lord<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45720:47"/>here prayed, that by this clear manifeſtation to the world, the world might believe that God had ſent him. For when the world believed that God had ſent Chriſt by the Convincing Signs and wonders, miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt that was then given, part of the world em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Faith, as St <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, <hi>and the word brought forth fruit in them,</hi> as it did in the Church of
<hi>Colloſſe,</hi> Chap. 1.6 For according to the Command of Chriſt,
<hi>The Goſpel was preached to every Creature under Heaven,</hi> Col. 1.23. And by the mighty ſigns and wonders that accompanied the Word, they were under a conviction, that Chriſt was the Son of <hi>God.</hi> And then there was a power in them, to go to him for the offered mercy. But when God, for ſin, withdraws from a Perſon, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Nation he then leaves them to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> and Chriſt ſo died for the World, that all that have not diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited themſelves will reap benefit by it.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt Churches were as a Candle lighted up by the Lord to enlighten the World, who lay in Wickedneſss and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And they being to withſtand all the fury of the Enemy at the Publication of the Goſpel. Therefore they had ſo great a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit given them.</p>
                  <p>And it was them whom the Diſciples taught, that received the Word from their mouth, and ſo believed in Chriſt thro' their Word,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45720:47"/>to whom Chriſt made theſe promiſes, <hi>Mark</hi>
16.15,16,17. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature. And theſe ſigns ſhall follow them that believe. In my Name ſhall they caſt out Devils. They ſhall ſpeak with new Tongues, they ſhall take up Serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it ſhall not hurt them. They ſhall lay hands on the Sick and they ſhall recover.</hi> By theſe words we ſee nothing can be more plain, than that Chriſt ſpake this of the then time, and of them that ſhould believe in him through the Word of the Diſciples as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their mouth. For this Chriſt ſpake of the remnant, and firſt Churches, unto whom the Holy Ghoſt was given to be in them, and of whom St <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things, and is true, and is no lie,</hi> 1 John 2.27. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of them, who had the Holy Ghoſt given to be in them, they needed no other teaching, but as the ſame anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting taught them. But ſome, not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirits teaching, went out from them, that was not of that remnant, as in the 19v.</p>
                  <p>But the Holy Ghoſt was not given to any till they were firſt brought home by the Call of the Word to yield their conſent to the tender of his Grace, as to turn from every evil way. For the Holy Ghoſt could
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45720:48"/>not be received into an unclean Heart.</p>
                  <p>And the Holy Ghoſt was then given, that thereby the world might believe that God had ſent Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And alſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of the then time, ſaith,
<hi>That God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing to them their Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. (That is, not laying their paſt ſins to the charge of them that laid hold of the tender of his Grace) So as none need fear, if they are not Elected, they ſhall not be accepted.</p>
                  <p>And after the Nations of the World had embraced the Faith, the Lord continued a ſtanding Witneſs amongſt them always to bear their Teſtimony to the Truth of the Goſpel. And they are they that lie in the ſtreet of the Great City. And when the Gentile Nations fell away as
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did; they remained to bear their Teſtimony to the truth againſt all the fury of the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Enemy. And when we come rightly to underſtand who were the Servants to whom Chriſt delivered the Talents; none will then think that the Fountain of all Wiſdom and Reaſon carries on his works according to the Council of his own Will, guided with out Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things that I have now hinted, will by God's aſſiſtance, be fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved in a ſhort time. And let us not<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45720:48"/>deceive our ſelves by a falſe Faith, or an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Election. For the Elect (that lie in the Street of the great City, and cry day and night unto God, by reaſon of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Enemy) we are not.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Elect that are to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the four Winds, we have not apprehended who they are, and they will appear to be them, that we are little aware of, as will be proved in the next Treatiſe. In which will be the ſigns of the times; The coming of the Lord; The Calling in of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> The Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon;</hi> And the Reſtitution of all things, clearly made evident by the word.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we had need look to it, how we ſtand as believers, leſt we ſhould have believed in vain, for the Lord is at hand, who will judge us according to our deeds, and according as our Works have been.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord of his mercy cauſing the true meaning of his Word to break forth for the vindication of his Juſtice, and for the exaltation of his mercy, let us therefore prepare for his coming, and unite to ſerve the Lord with one conſent, and be found of him in peace.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith upon the firſt publication of the Goſpel, <hi>How ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> Rom. 10.14,15. For the <pb n="92" facs="tcp:45720:49"/>firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were ſent forth by the Lord, and inſtructed by him what to teach. But when the Goſpel was eſtabliſht, then the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>And as many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> And then they were not to wait for new Calls, but to walk according to the Rule that was ſet before them, leſt they ſhould be caſt off again as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was. For God by his word continually calls upon us to walk in obedience to him. But ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to obey, are the ground <hi>bearing Thorns and Briers, which is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing; whoſe end is to be burned,</hi> Heb. 6. verſe 8. <hi>Mat.</hi>
16.24,25,26,27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>But the offer of mercy is to whomſoever will that they may come and take the waters of life freely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. That is, If they are willing to yield ſubjection to his laws, then they may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come. For every one that thirſteth are invited to the waters, and they that have no money may buy and eat, without money and without price, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. So as the poor are not excluded for want of money; nor the Gentile ſinners upon the publication of the Goſpel, were not exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of Righteouſneſs, if they did thirſt after it. For the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt was imputed for the Juſtification of any that were willing for the future to render their ſincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him. For it was their paſt ſins, that<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45720:49"/>were committed before their converſion, which were remitted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. But, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>let them not turn again to folly Pſ.</hi> 85.8. And tho' the remnant and firſt Churches were not fore choſen for their willing and running. Yet the Crown of Life was to be attained by their willing and running: And ſo it is by all that will lay hold on it. But when the Gentile Nations cme to have no love to the truth, then God left them to ſtrong deluſions that they might be damned, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10,11,12. And Oh! that this may be a warning to us, that we may receive the knowledge of the truth in the love thereof, that our Souls may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>For we are not only to believe in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.</p>
                  <p>For this was the determined counſel of God, that, ſeeing he was to part with the Son of his love, to ſuffer for ſinners, that ſuch as would not in this time deny themſelves for him, ſhould in time to come ſuffer by him, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.34,35,36,37,38. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.</p>
                  <p>But we having loſt the ancient way of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaking, and the right apprehenſion of the Kingdom that is to come and miſtakingly taking all that was ſaid to the firſt Churches, and all that was ſaid as relating to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the time of the Reſtitution of all things, as tho' they now belong'd to us; by reaſon of which weare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in great and dangerous miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:45720:50"/>GOD Bleſs King <hi>William;</hi> and in theſe times make him more bleſſed in Conquering of Hearts than Nations, by the incouraging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Knowledge of the truth. For the door of mercy is open to all that will lay hold of the tender of his Grace. So as none need fear, that if they are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, they ſhall not be accepted. For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him Come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we may with confidence rely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Word, <hi>for he is faithful that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,</hi> and his faithfulneſs cannot fail. And the invitations and drawings of God, are with the Cords of a man, and with the bands of Love, <hi>Hoſea Ch.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. So as the will is left, either to chuſe, or refuſe the ſame. And tho' God may ſometimes go out of his uſual way of working, and as it were, pluck a brand out of the burning; yet that perſon no longer ſecurely ſtands, than he willingly devotes himſelf to his Makers Service. But when he will have none of his Counſel, but deſpiſes his reproof, then will the Lord laugh at the Calamity of ſuch, and mock when their fear cometh, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.25,26,27. Which as a whirlwind will come ſuddenly, and now is very nigh at hand.</p>
                  <p>But yet the door of mercy is open to all that will repent and turn from their evil ways, ſo as they may eſcape the wrath to come,

<hi>Luke</hi> 21.25. or whether the beginning of the limited time was, when the Evil Spirits mentioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 16.13,14 came <hi>out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe prophet, which has gathered together the Kings of the earth, to the battel of the great day of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And by theſe the World is now in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, as in, 2 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 9.3,4. and alſo the Lord ſaith in <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 21.25,26,27. <hi>There ſhall be diſtreſs of nations, with perplexity, the ſea and the waves thereof roaring, mens hearts failing them for fear, and looking after thoſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the earth, for the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> By which is meant the ruling powers of the earth, which in Scripture, is alſo called the Heavens. And then it is the Lord will come, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>And then ſhall they ſee the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</hi> And it is alſo given us as a Sign of the Lord's coming, the often breakings forth of fire out of the earth; altho' Hiſtory gives us an account that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were fired before Chriſt came. The <hi>Romans</hi> being formerly the afflicters of the natural Seed of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> as ſince they have alſo been of the adopted Seed of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> for which, with their other abominable ſins, the anger of the Lord has been kindled againſt them, yet before the coming of the Lord, it is declared by the Angel to <hi>Eſdras, There ſhall be confuſion in many places, and fire ſhall be oft ſent out again,</hi> 2 <hi>Eſd.</hi> 5.8.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45720:59"/>which hath lately in a wonderful manner been fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Now all along in the Scripture, the Afflictions of the Natural, and of the Adopted Seed are joyned together; ſo here in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. from the beginning to the 14. <hi>verſe,</hi> in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner treats of the miſcarriage, and puniſhment of the natural Seed of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And beginning at the 14th <hi>verſe</hi> to the 24th treats of the puniſhment of the adopted Seed of <hi>Jacob.</hi> For in the 16th
<hi>verſe</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts ſhall be exalted in Judgment:</hi> At which time the Lambs ſhall feed after their manner. Therefore this is to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled when the Lord again comes: Againſt which time it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth wide without meaſure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it.</hi> This doth evidently appear, that Hell hath enlarged her ſelf by theſe often torrents and rivers of Fire, Pitch, and Bitumen, which God hath lately ſent out thence. According to the Word of God in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> Chap. 32.22.
<hi>For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn to the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the Earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foundations of the Mountains.</hi> By theſe words we are to underſtand, that the fire of Hell and the fire in the Foundations of theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains extendeth it ſelf from the one, to the other: This is further treated of in a Book that is to come forth. And it is alſo ſaid in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 30.
<hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>For Tophet is ordained of old; yea for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45720:60"/>King it is prepared, he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood, the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of Brimſtone, doth kindle it.</hi> This Tophet here ſpoken of, is Hell; the King for whom it was prepared, is the Devil; but Man that is inſnared by him does alſo fall into it. For the Lord ſaith, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Matth.</hi> 25.41. But all Hell will not be fired, till the laſt and final Judgment, when all the dead will be judged, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>The pile thereof is fire and much wood:</hi> That is, much combuſtible matter fit for fuel, as Brimſtone, Pitch, Sulpher, Bitumen Coperas, and the like. Theſe things the Lord hath ſo placed; and by his breath and command, he hath kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it. And it is ſaid of the Beaſt, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that after the Lord comes, they were both taken, and caſt alive into a Lake of fire burning with Brimſtone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. which Lake is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy kindled, into which they ſhall be caſt, which reacheth to the loweſt Hell.</p>

                  <p>NOW are the Whirlwinds of the Lord gone forth according to the Word of the Lord: <hi>Behold, the Whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continual Whirlwind, it ſhall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord ſhall not return until he hath done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye ſhall conſider, Jer.</hi> 30.23,24.<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45720:60"/>Theſe Whirlwinds are the continual afflictions, wars, and commotions which are upon the Earth, which will not ceaſe, till the Lord hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the intents of his heart. Theſe things alſo are ſet down for them that have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to conſider of, that thereby they may know what the Lord is going about to do, as to underſtand the time of their viſitation. And again it is ſaid,
<hi>Come near ye Nations to hear, and hearken ye my people: let the Earth hear, and all that is therein, the World, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all Nations, and his fury upon all their Armies, Iſa.</hi> 34.1,2. And of this time the Lord ſaith in <hi>Eſdras; For the Lord knoweth all them that ſin againſt him, and therefore delivereth he them unto death and deſtruction. For now are the Plagues come upon the whole Earth, and ye ſhall remain in them: for God ſhall not deliver you, becauſe ye have ſinned againſt him,</hi> 2 Eſd. 15.26,27. This being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> That <hi>theſe Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds of trouble ſhall not ceaſe in the world, until the Lord have performed the intents of his heart;</hi> Which is, in making his Enemies his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, and in coming to take his own great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Reign, and to reſtore his People.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaith to his people concerning this preſent time; 2 <hi>Eſd.</hi> 16.39,40,41. <hi>Even ſo ſhall not the Plagues be ſlack to come upon the earth, and the world ſhall mourn, and ſorrow ſhall come upon it on every ſide. O my people hear my word: make ye ready to the battel. And in thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45720:61"/>be even as Pilgrims upon the Earth: He that ſelleth, let him be as one that fleeth away: And he that buyeth, as one that will loſe: He that occupieth Merchandice, as he that hath no profit by it: And he that buildeth, as he that ſhall not dwell therein,</hi> &amp;c. And it is ſaid in the 47. v. <hi>And thoſe that occupy their Merchandice with Robbery, the more they deck their Cities, their Houſes, their own poſſeſſions, and their own perſons, the more I will be angry with them for their ſins, ſaith the Lord.</hi> By this robbery is meant all unjuſt gain, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful dealing with one another.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.11,12. <hi>The lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughtineſs of men ſhall be bowed down, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low.</hi> And the like the Lord ſaith in <hi>Malachy,</hi> Chap. 4.1,2. <hi>For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither Root nor Branch. But unto them that fear my Name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings, and ye ſhall go forth and grow up as Calves of the ſtall.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Mat</hi> 7.19,21.
<hi>Every Tree that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and caſt into the fire.</hi> And he alſo ſaith, <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45720:61"/>of Heaven: But he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> For when the Lord comes it will not ſerve our turns, to ſay; that we believed in his Righteouſneſs for Salvation. But how we have obeyed him, in doing the will of his Father which is in Heaven, that thereby his Righteouſneſs may be imputed to us. <hi>Who is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him, Heb.</hi> 5.9. For now it is not with us, as it was with the Gentiles at their firſt Calling in, who had never heard of Chriſt, nor what he required of them. But it is with us, as it was with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from whom God expected an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their day and ſeaſon of Grace; the which for their not doing, they were caſt off. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20,21. <hi>If God ſpared not the Natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee.</hi> Thereby ſhewing, that we ſtand no ſurer than <hi>Iſrael</hi> did. Therefore he ſaith, ver. 20.
<hi>Be not high minded but fear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore let all that deſire to have an intereſt in him, humble themſelves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt them in due time. And the Lord ſpeaking of his ſecond coming, ſaith, 2

And how many thouſand years it will be after Satan is caſt into the fire of Hell, before the final judgment, the Lord beſt knoweth; But by the word it is clear, it will be many thouſand years. For God hath ſaid, <hi>He will keep Covenant and mercy to a thouſand Generations,</hi> Deut 7.9. And from <hi>Adam</hi> to this time, we cannot well reckon above a hundred Generations. For where St.
<hi>Luke</hi> counts the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt, he reckons up but about three ſcore Generations, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And this fore-mentioned Kingdom, is the Kingdom of which the Angel told the bleſſed Virgin, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould Reign over the Houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end,</hi> Luke 1.33.

<hi>to fly away,</hi> Re. 20.11. The fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Book explaineth the meaning thereof; fully making it appear by the word, there is two ſorts of Heavens, and Earth; whereby it is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, that the Kingdom of Chriſt will have no end; according to the word of the Angel to the Bleſſed Virgin, and according to the word of the Lord in <hi>Daniel; But the Saints of the moſt High ſhall take the Kingdom, and poſſeſs the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever, even for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 7.18.

But none need Queſtion but God will make them of ability to do what he requires of them.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>That every one that is left of all the Nations.</hi> That is, every one of the Nations that were left ſhould go up yearly to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but not that it is there meant that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual perſon of the Nations will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to go up year by year unto

                  <p>Now what we find written in the old and new Teſtament, and nothing therein to contradict the plain meaning thereof, that will of certain be fulfilled in the plain and clear way, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. But that is a figurative Speech, and not to be taken in the letter of the word, where we find other Scriptures in contradiction to it. There God hath a ſecret vail'd in it, which he reſerves until ſuch time as he will have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>

This <hi>Zion,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is meant of the glorious Tabernacles ſpoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2.</p>
                  <p>But we all coming out of the Darkneſs of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, have loſt the right apprehenſion of this<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45720:67"/>Kingdom or World to come, whereby we are involved in great miſtakes, ſo as to think the promiſed everlaſting Covenant is now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that ſuch as belong to it may fall foully, but not finally; but when that Covenant is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; then it is <hi>that God will put his fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, ſo as they ſhall never depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32.40.

And this being the only viſible Kingdom that God has in the time of this World; which Kingdom or People, is not in ſhew of this World's greatneſs and grandeur.

Now the Lord all along whilſt he was upon the Earth, ſpake but in Parables as to his ſecond coming and Kingdom,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.34. by reaſon <hi>Iſrael</hi> being ſinful, for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of God, they ſhould be left to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer by them; for tho' in other things they ſinned wilfully, yet they ignorantly crucified the Lord of Life, <hi>Acts</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:45720:72"/>And the Lord again ſpeaking of his ſecond coming, and of gathering the Nations; and by the Parable of ſetting the Sheep on his right hand, and the Goats on his left; <hi>He ſaith to them on his right hand, come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World,</hi> Matth. 25.34. Now from the foundation of the material Heavens and Earth, there was no other Kingdom prepared but this World, which will be again reſtored. But the Law and Goſpel ſpeaking but to thoſe that are under it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. and
<hi>chap.</hi> 2.12,14. The Lord might therefore have his reference to the foundation of the World that was laid in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the World to come; at which foundation. Chriſt was figuratively ſlain in the Paſchal Lamb: And then was the Kingdom of <hi>Canaan</hi> prepared for
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> by their Enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And the Gentiles that Chriſt ſhall find in obedience amongſt the Chriſtian Nations at his coming, will then be made the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of this Kingdom. For they were not only to be Heirs with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the promiſed Everlaſting Covenant, whereby Eternal Life is ſecured to the Soul; but they were alſo to have a ſhare with them in their Inheritance: For of <hi>Japhet</hi> it was propheſied, that he ſhould dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem;</hi> and therefore this Kingdom may likewiſe be ſaid to be prepared for them: And alſo at the reſtoration of all things, it is that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> will be reſtored to their own Land, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.16.
<hi>And then will God make her Wilderneſs<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45720:72"/>like Eden, and her Deſart like the Garden of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 51.3. And then it is Chriſt will have his peaceable Kingdom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain: for the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 65.23,24,25. <hi>And in that day God will make a Covenant for them, with the Beaſt of the Field, and with the Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and he will break the Bow, and the Sword, and the Battel out of the Earth, and will make them lie down ſafely,</hi> Hoſea 2.18,19. <hi>And then will God betroth them unto him for ever in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving-kindneſs, and in mercies,</hi> v. 19. And then, this is the Peace the Lord hath declared ſhall be in the time of his Kingdom. But when Chriſt firſt came, he ſaid, he came <hi>not to ſend Peace on Earth, but a Sword,</hi> Matth. 10.34. For in this time, them that are the true Followers of Chriſt, the Devil will be ſtill raiſing them up Enemies. And Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples,
<hi>That in him, they might have peace; but in the World, they ſhould have tribulation,</hi> John 16.33. And likewiſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>That after his departure, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among them, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Flock. And alſo of their own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them,</hi> Acts
20.29,30. which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly followed.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>When a mans ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh his Enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> This King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45720:73"/>of the natural Seed of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> which had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the fear of the Lord, they had then been the Emblem of that peaceable Kingdom that is now to come: And they in this time ſhould have been the Head, and not the Tail, and above only,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.13. But there never was any ſuch promiſe made to the true Churches of Chriſt in this time; but on the contrary, they were foretold they ſhould be afflicted, perſecuted, and meet with fiery Tryals; neither were they to adorn themſelves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.</p>

                  <head>Chap. XV. The Elect Church diſcovered. And why God ſuffered the Beaſt to ariſe to deceive the Nations. Alſo a twofold being in the Book of Life.</head>
                  <p>NOW Chriſt by his Word declareth that he would have an Elect Church or People throughout this World, that ſhould never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Beaſt, or falſe Prophet. And that it was to his Diſciples which came of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unto whom Chriſt promiſed to be with to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 38.20. And that none ſhould pluck them out of his hand. And tho' the firſt Gentile Churches that received the Word from the mouth of the Diſciples, were likewiſe alſo Elected, and fore-choſen of God, and made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt; yet their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations, were but raiſed to that from which
<hi>Iſrael</hi> fell. And God foreſeeing that the Gentile Nations that embraced the Goſpel, would afterward fall away, by having no love to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45720:73"/>Truth, but taking pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, as
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the People of Old had done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21,22. therefore it was determined of God they ſhould be left to ſtrong deluſions to believe a Lye: Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10,11,12. For which cauſe it was the determination of God, that all that dwell upon the Earth ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt, whoſe names are not written in the Book of Life, of the Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi>
13.7,8. That is, all the Kindreds, and Tongues, and Nations that dwell upon all the Earth, that the Beaſt had dominion over, ſhould worſhip him, except thoſe whoſe Names were written in the Book of Life; for the Word ſpeaks to them that received it, and it was thoſe fell into the ſnare, that had not a love to it, but took pleaſure in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And
<hi>Luther</hi> ſays, that the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, are generally comprehended under one head, And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8. <hi>And they that dwell upon the Earth ſhall wonder, whoſe names were not written in the Book of Life from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, when they behold the Beaſt.</hi> Now, I have already proved by the Word in a Treatiſe concerning Election, that there was no Election through the firſt World of People, nor till after the miſcarriage of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Then did the Lord ſecure a certain rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of them to himſelf, at which time
<hi>Iſrael</hi> was laid for the foundation of the World to come; for all that come in as Heirs to that<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45720:74"/>World, come in as the Seed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and from that foundation, Chriſt was figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlain in the Paſchal Lamb; and from that foundation, were the works of thoſe unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews finiſhed that fell in the Wilderneſs when they refuſed to go to fight for the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And becauſe of
<hi>Iſrael</hi>'s miſcarriage, the firſt Gentile Churches were choſen to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Holy Ghoſt, and to bear their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Truth; the which are ſaid to be <hi>choſen before the foundation of the World,</hi> which foundation was <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the which choice, was not before them as to matter of time, but as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of choice and liking in God, rather to make choice of them that ſhould ignorantly offend him, than them that had wilfully diſobeyed him. And I alſo have proved, that the Eternal Purpoſe, has only a relation to the Eternity that lies before us; that the being choſen from the beginning, was no other, than from the beginning of the Preaching of the Goſpel. And I have alſo proved, that the Decree was made, that the Entrances into Life ſhould be made ſtrait, after
<hi>Adam</hi> fell, and how that ſtraitneſs doth conſiſt: And what is meant, by being of old ordained to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And alſo I have proved in the Book in which the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is explained, that them of the World embraced the Faith, in the Apoſtles time, and brought forth fruit, as it did in the Elect Churches. All theſe things I have made clear, which hitherto we have not rightly underſtood, which makes me the oftener recite them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45720:74"/>Theſe things being proved, it makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there was none Elected from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but the remnant. And alſo the firſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Churches that were afterward Elected were long departed this life, before the Beaſt aroſe, ſo as there was none of them then to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him.</p>
                  <p>Now there is alſo a twofold way of being in the Book of Life. Firſt, They that have their names there. Secondly, Thoſe that have a part therein, and it is thoſe that have their names there, that are Elected and fore-choſen. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt Gentile Churches were called in, their Children were taken into Covenant, and a Door of Mercy ſet open to all ſuch as would take hold of the offer of Life according as it is tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt. Now if theſe have not their names put into the Book of Life when they are taken into Covenant, yet they have their part in the Book of Life, in performing the conditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Life is offered by Chriſt (for thoſe he will juſtifie by his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.) The which name or part in the Book of Life, may not only be loſt through negligence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, but by adding or diminiſhing from the Word, <hi>Rev.</hi>
22.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. And there are others alſo that have a part in the Book of Life, which will find Redemption in the World to come; for they were ſuch as received not the Truth in the love of it, but took pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that the Apoſtle ſaith ſhould be damned, 2
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. And they were ſuch as<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45720:75"/>heard the Truth, and would not believe to obey it, that the Lord gave Sentence againſt. But thoſe that have had a longing deſire after the Truth, and ſuch as have not taken pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs, ſuch will find Redemption in the World to come. And no young Children can take pleaſure in iniquity: Therefore when all come to be judged according to their works, ſuch will be cleared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14,15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. But I ſhall not here inſiſt upon this Subject, becauſe I intend hereafter fully to prove it. But by what the Lord ſaith, it is of dangerous conſequence to take from the Word, as well as to add unto it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Gentile Chriſtians, when they came to have no love to the Truth whereby they might be ſaved, but on the contrary, took pleaſure in iniquity, God gave them up to worſhip the Beaſt; for when they would not be bound with the Cords of his Laws, and follow him in Love, Patience, and Humility, in expectation of the reward of the Crown of Life, when the Lord again ſhall come; then it was God permitted the Prince of Darkneſs to ſet up his pretended Kingdom, by which deluſion they alſo loſt the apprehenſion of the glorious Kingdom of Chriſt, which is now to come, and is very nigh at hand, which Kingdom has been foretold by all the Prophets, ſworn to by God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.2. declared by the Apoſtles: And becauſe the Lord Chriſt ſpake but in dark Sentences and Parables, when he was upon the Earth, becauſe that <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45720:75"/>being ſinful, thereby might be blinded: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he declared in Viſion to St. <hi>John,</hi> how he would come, and of the glory of the New
<hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> that ſhould come down from Heaven, and of his reigning Power here upon the Earth, Alſo annexing thoſe great threatnings mentioned
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18,19. to any that ſhould add or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh to the words of this Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>Now all the Gentile Chriſtians thus falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deluſion, ſo as when any of them come out of that darkneſs by the knowledge of the Word, it was evident to them, they could not be of that remnant that ſhould never be deceived, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon themſelves knew, that they, or their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had been deceived by the Beaſt; but as to that Remnant, Church or People, that the Word does thus bear witneſs to, I ſhall not here ſpeak further of; but hereafter, by God's aſſiſtance, I ſhall declare who the Two Witneſſes are, and then I ſhall make appear who this Church, and People, and Remnant are, to whom the Word doth thus bear witneſs to, and they to the Word: Whilſt on the contrary, the Apoſtate Church, or great Harlot, bear not witneſs to the Word, nor the Word to her, any otherwiſe than to her condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

                  <p>NOW when God does Elect, or fore-chuſe any Perſon, or perſons, it is not only to be an advantage to themſelves, but alſo to carry on the Counſel of the will of God in the purpoſe he hath determined; As the Remnant for a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding witneſs. The firſt Churches likewiſe to partake of the Holy Ghoſt, and to bear their teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to the truth of the Goſpel. And alſo they were to withſtand the fury of the enemy, and to meet with fiery tryals. Theſe things were ſo certainly alotted here their portion, that they were not to think ſtrange of it; <hi>Pet.</hi>— neither are <hi>Iſrael</hi> that will be taken in and be the Lords Elect in time to come, choſen only for themſelves, but alſo to carry on the Counſel of the will of God, that the other Nations that are ſpared might be bleſſed in them, who are given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45720:77"/>Daughters and Servants; Who in ſome meaſure will partake of the glory: And alſo in this time, if God doth elect or chuſe any ſingle perſon, it is not only for the benefit of that perſon, but to carry on the Counſel of the Will of God. As <hi>Joſiah,</hi> he was to break down the Altars of the falſe Gods. And <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to reſtore <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their own Land. And <hi>Luther,</hi> to bring the Goſpel again to light, that others that would, might take hold of the offers of mercy.</p>
                  <p>I hope that His Majeſty, and the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the Nation will take theſe things into their conſideration, that thro' their incouraging the Knowledge of the truth, it may meet with better ſucceſs than it did in <hi>Swedeland.</hi> For when the good Miniſters that truely feared God, ſeeing the Signs the Lord foretold ſhould be before his coming, and thereby apprehending his near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, was willing to acquaint the people, that thereby they might prepare for the coming of the Lord, ſo as they might not be found in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at that day; and that day come upon them at unawares. But the greater part withſtood the truth, like the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, and would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Knowledge of it, and preſently ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Miniſters in <hi>Holland</hi> to continue as they were. The certainty of this came over in the Monthly Mercury.</p>
                  <p>And I alſo heard by an Outlandiſh Miniſter, that when the good Miniſters of that Country, upon the ſigns the Lord had given of his coming, and they knowing there was a great deal of the<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45720:78"/>Scripture unrevealed, therefore deſired that they might joyn in earneſt prayers to the Lord for the right underſtanding of his word; and to leave off their Scholaſtick, way of preaching, and more to ſtudy the Word. But thoſe that were in the wrong, being the ſtrongeſt party would not yield thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But I hope our Miniſters, and Teachers, of all Parties, will not follow their Example; ſince it is made ſo clearly evident, that the ſtroke will fall on the Chriſtians, that ſhall be found in darkneſs at that day. And ſince we have been all in miſtakes, ſome more, and ſome leſs, till God of his mercy, now again brought the true meaning of his word to light, according to his promiſe, as we therefore may the better pity and pray one for the other; and by a ſpeedy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, break off from our ſins by working righteouſneſs, and in ſhewing mercy to the poor, who are at this day languiſhing: And alſo by our owning the whole truth, that thereby we may unite and ſerve the Lord with one conſent And that by us the Proteſtant Churches beyond Sea might be warned; and that by our and their owning the whole truth, it may give ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm to the Chriſtian World, that many Millions of Souls might come out of Darkneſs.

And whereas he ſaith, leſt there ſhould be among you a root that beareth Gall and Wormwood: Now a root doth ſignify one of the Tribes, or the major part of a tribe; for in the Scripture, the greater number is taken for the whole; and a Man or Woman, or ſingle family, is but a bough or branch of a root. Now a root hath its ſpringing, increaſing and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; and we know that the Tribes when ſpoken of ſingly, are termed as one Man, as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and
<hi>Benjamin, Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the which each of them ſignifies a Tribe. Now thoſe that are brought in to be of the Seed of

                  <p>By theſe words we find alſo, that out of this root of Bitterneſs would ſpring up trouble, and thereby many ſhould be defiled; which, by ſad experience has been made evident. And the Apoſtle alſo here compares him to <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe repreſentative he is, or Figure of him; altho many degrees worſe, therefore for him is reſerv'd the worſer Puniſhment, who as <hi>Eſau</hi> parted with his Birthright, ſo this Man here ſpoken of, parted with the promiſed Bleſſing which was for Eternity, for this World's mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.

<hi>And that the whole land thereof is brimſtone and ſalt, and burning, that it is not ſown, nor beareth, nor any graſs groweth therein, like the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we are to take notice what are the ſins againſt whom God did by <hi>Moſes,</hi> pronounce theſe Ireful Judgments, as in
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18,19. <hi>Leſt there ſhould be among you a root that bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth gall and wormwood. And it come to paſs when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, tho I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we are to conſider what the Scripture calls Dunkenneſs, beſides that exceſs of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Liquor. In the firſt place, God men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions another ſort of Drunkenneſs by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi>
32.42. <hi>I will make mine Arrows drunk with Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Drunkenneſs which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of is mentioned by St. <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 17.6. <hi>And I ſaw the woman drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the Martyrs of Jeſus; and when I ſaw her I wondred with great admiration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Woman that was thus Drunken, is myſtical
<hi>Babylon,</hi> as in the 5. v. of this chapter, and in the 3. v. ſhe is termed, <hi>Babylon the great,<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45720:82"/>the mother of harlots, and the abomination of the earth.</hi> The Beaſt that beareth her, that is, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her up in her Grandeur and Greatneſs, is the Pope; which ſets himſelf up as a God. And this is the man that addeth Drunkenneſs to his thirſt, for he firſt thirſteth after the Blood of the Saints, of which he hath taken ſo much with her, that they are become Drunken with it. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.6. It is ſaid, <hi>They have ſhed the Blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, God would blot out that Mans Name from under Heaven. So it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20,22.
<hi>That he was caſt alive into the lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the 22. v. we are in eſpecial manner to take notice of, in that he ſaith, The Generation to come of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that he doth not here in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſay Generations, but Generation. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the manner of our Lord Chriſt,
<hi>David</hi> and others, in that they mention this Wicked World as one Generation: And the Elect, with their Generations in the Glorious time, another Generation. And whereas he ſaith, the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that ſhall come from a far Land up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he ſaith, When they ſee the Plagues of that Land, and the Sickneſs which the Lord hath laid upon it. Here we ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> does not term it <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Land, or the Land they were going to poſſeſs, or <hi>Canaan,</hi> but that Land whereby it is plain, it was not meant their Land,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45720:82"/>Now after the Lord again comes, and the Judgment of this World is paſt, 'tis ſaid <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Every one ſhall go up from year to year to Worſhip the King the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then it is, thoſe ſtrangers that in their journey paſs by that Land up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſee that the whole Land thereof is become Brimſtone and Salt and Burning, nor any Graſs groweth therein, like the overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and
<hi>Zeboim,</hi> which the Lord overthrew in his Anger, and in his Wrath,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.24. <hi>Even all the Nations ſhall ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Lord done thus unto this Land, what meaneth the heat of his great Anger?</hi> 25. <hi>Then men ſhall ſay, becauſe they have forſaken the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord God of their Fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the Land of Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as I before ſhewed you, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant included ſtrangers that were to be brought in for time to come; which by Chriſt, ſhould become the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And ſo alſo, the Covenant was made with our Fathers, when they came out of the Land of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But you may ſay that Chriſt came out of one Tribe, and therefore the Covenant not made with our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which words include more than one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To which I Anſwer, That whilſt <hi>Judah</hi> was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from him ſprang many Fathers of Families: But peradventure, you may ſay, that Chriſt could not come of all the Families of <hi>Judah.</hi> To which I Anſwer, That by the<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45720:83"/>Father and Mother's ſide, of whom, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fleſh Chriſt came, there was then when this Covenant was made, many of our Fathers; alſo conſidering that then they lived to ſee the fourth Generation of their Children. Now in the 26. v. forward,
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems alſo to intermix <hi>Iſrael</hi> vvith this Degenerate Root; for in the 26. v. he ſaith, <hi>They went and ſerved other Gods, and Worſhipped them, Gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them.</hi> 27. v. <hi>And the Anger of the Lord was kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Land, to bring upon it all the Curſes that are written in this Book.</hi> That is, This Land, which he before had been ſpeaking of, on vvhich ſhall be made out all the ſeverer Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are Written in this Book of the Lavv. And as many of the Curſes as have not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Land, will be inflicted on that Root that beareth Gall and Wormwood, and their Land; to whom the ſevereſt of them doth particularly belong, as I before ſhewed you. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the 28. v. <hi>The Lord rooted them out of their Land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and caſt them into another land, as it is this day.</hi> 29. v. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God: But thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us, and our Children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the 28. verſe,
<hi>That the Lord rooted them out of their Land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation.</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45720:83"/>The which words alſo have a reference to <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> becauſe God, for their Sins, did caſt out the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> out of their Land. But whereas he ſaith, The Lord caſt them into an other Land, as it is this Day. But now when this queſtion is ſaid, ſhould be asked, and this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer return'd, it was after the time of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to them of that Generation that are partakers of that bleſſedneſs which then will be revealed. And whereas he ſaith, caſt them into another Land, which was quite different from <hi>Judah's</hi> Curſe; for they were to be ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Four Winds, and from one end of the Earth to the other.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I fear the Land here ſpoken of, that theſe are to be caſt into, will be that which is mentioned <hi>Job</hi> 10.22. <hi>A Land of Darkneſs, as Darkneſs it ſelf.</hi> For the time when theſe words were ſpoken, would not admit him more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mention them. Now
<hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. to let them underſtand that there was ſomething here interwoven, or that his words had a Two-fold meaning, that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> might not be too much diſcouraged, and that alſo the true Chriſtians might thereby be enlightned, as concerning this Root of Bitterneſs, when God ſhall open their Eyes to ſee it; in that he ſaith to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>That ſecret things belong to God, but thoſe things that are revealed belong to us, and to our Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are a great many ſecret things in the Book of God, which this Word may have<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45720:84"/>ſome Reference to; but to aſſure us here was a Secret; and therefore to this place is this Word Secret linked only.</p>
                  <p>So in the following Chapter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. he treats of
<hi>Iſrael's</hi> repenting, and returning; and in the 6. v. he ſaith,
<hi>God will circumciſe their heart, and the heart of their Seed, to love the Lord their God with all their heart, and with all their ſoul, that they may live.</hi> And he ſaith in the 7. v. <hi>The Lord thy God will put all theſe Curſes upon thine Enemies, and on them that hate thee, which perſecuted thee.</hi> 8. v. <hi>And thou ſhalt return, and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.</hi> 9. v. <hi>And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land for good; for the Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoyced over thy Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from the 10. v downward, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the then time, how they ſhould walk with God: For in the 11. v. he ſaith,
<hi>This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which I command thee this day, it is not hid from thee, neither is it far off.</hi> 14. v. <hi>But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayeſt do it.</hi> 15. v. <hi>See, I have ſet before thee this day life and good, and Death and Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Covenant we ſee here in the 6. <hi>v.</hi> was the promiſed Covenant, in which God would Circumciſe their heart, and the heart of their Seed, that they ſhould love the Lord their God<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45720:84"/>with all their Heart, and with all their Soul, that they may live and do all his Commandments; As it is ſaid in the 8. <hi>v.</hi> But now it is the knowledge of the Covenant is put into our mouths, and in our hearts. And therefore he ſaith, that they, and we may do it: For he ſaith <hi>I have ſet before thee, Life and Good, Death and Evil.</hi> 16. v. <hi>In that I Command thee this Day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his Commandments, and his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and his Judgments that thou mayeſt live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when a <hi>Lawyer</hi> asked our Saviour Chriſt what he ſhould do to inherit Eternal Life, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.26,27,28,29. <hi>He ſaid unto him, what is written in the Law? How readeſt thou?</hi> 27. v.
<hi>And he anſwering, ſaid, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> 28. v. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, thou haſt anſwered right, this do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.40. <hi>On theſe two Commands hang all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
                  </p>

To whom the Words of this Song, to the half part of the 21. ver. do particularly belong. In which he makes mention of thoſe things which were to come upon them, as tho they had been already paſt. And from the half part of the 21. verſe to the
25. verſe, he ſpeaks of that degenerate Root of Gall and Wormwood; of whom God ſaid in the latter part of the 21. v. to <hi>Iſrael, I will move them to Jealouſie with thoſe that are not a people;</hi> I <hi>will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to Anger with a fooliſh Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> directeth theſe very Words in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 10.19. as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were the fooliſh Nation vvith vvhom <hi>Iſrael ſhould be moved to Jealouſie,</hi> and provoked to Anger vvithal. Firſt, moved to Jealouſie, in that the Meſſias vvas preached and offered to them, to bring them into covenant vvith God. Secondly, Anger, in that they brought on them that miſerable deſtruction vvhich remains to this day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45720:85"/>Novv vvhen St. <hi>Paul</hi> vvrote this Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> but ſevv of them had received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But he, to bear vvitneſs to the truth, and knovving that it vvas that Nation vvhich by God vvas termed to be the fooliſh Nation: A fooliſh Nation, in that vvhen they had received the Knovvledge of the Truth, they abode not in the commandment delivered to them, by vvhich Chriſt and the Promiſes are attainable.</p>
                  <p>The which was made with their Fathers at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when they came out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they ſhould not worſhip other Gods, nor make unto themſelves any Graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, that they ſhould not commit Idolatry, nor Blaſphemy, Murder, Breach of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, Adultery, Fornication and Theft; all which, and much more, is their continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And their Theft is, in taking the peoples ſubſtance, for their Pardons and Indulgences; (for there is none that can forgive ſins but God only.) Theſe horrible crying ſins, with their unſatiable blood-thirſty cruelty to the Saints and Servants of God: By which their willful and abominable Diſobedience excludes them from the mercy promiſed in and through Chriſt, and will bring upon them all thoſe intolerable Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are here pronounced againſt their Land, and themſelves; they being that Root of Gall and Wormwood, againſt whom thoſe worſer Curſes did particularly belong.</p>
                  <p>Novv that this Fooliſhneſs vvas meant by their falling off, <hi>Paul</hi> makes it further evident<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45720:86"/>by vvhat he vvrote to the <hi>Galathians:</hi> In vvhich he ſays, <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Galathians, <hi>who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Novv vve ſee here, that he terms theſe Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh upon the ſame account as the other vvere ſo termed. But here he rehearſeth not the Words of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe they related not unto them, but unto the former: For in the follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> his
<hi>Song,</hi> God ſaith of this Fooliſh Nation, <hi>Deut.</hi>
32.22,23,24. <hi>For a fire is kindled in mine Anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt Hell, and ſhall conſume the Earth with her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſet on fire the Foundations of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> 23. v. <hi>I will heap miſchiefs upon them;</hi> I <hi>will ſpend mine arrows upon them.</hi> 24. v. <hi>They ſhall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter deſtruction:</hi> I <hi>will alſo ſend the Teeth of Beaſts upon them, with the poyſon of Serpents of the duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we know that theſe Judgments here ſet down were not inflicted on <hi>Iſraels</hi> Land; but we ſee them evidently made out in this <hi>Roman Eſaus</hi> Land, vvhich is that root of bitterneſs. And vvhereas God ſaith, a Fire is kindled in mine Anger, vvhich ſhall burn to the lovveſt Hell: by vvhich vve may plainly ſee, that there is more than one Hell. And this Word of his, gives us fully to underſtand, vvhence this Fire comes, that does thus conſume the Foundations of the Mountains, that it is the Anger of God vvhich cauſes it; vvhich Fire extends it ſelf dovvn to the lovveſt Hell, and<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45720:86"/>riſeth upvvard into the Earth, the vvhich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes the Earth vvith her increaſe, by thoſe Torrents or Rivers of Fire, the vvhich proceed from the Foundations of thoſe Mountains; the vvhich Mountains God hath ſet as Signs for theſe ſeveral hundred years, as a mark for the fulfilling of theſe Propheſies, and to inlighten the thinking Chriſtians, that they might know to vvhom theſe Judgments did appertain; and alſo, that they might make preparation for the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Novv vvhereas God ſaith in the 24. v. <hi>I will alſo ſend the Teeth of Beaſts upon them, with the Poyſon of Serpents of the Duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The meaning of which vvords is much like to vvhat
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.6. The vvhich af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given an Account of the <hi>Day of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and the year of recompence for the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy of</hi> Sion, he ſpeaks of this <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Land, vvhich is this root of Bitterneſs; <hi>That the ſtreams thereof ſhall be turned into Pitch, and the duſt thereof into Brimſtone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And alſo in the 14. v. in anſwer to that of the Teeth of Beaſts, It is here ſaid, <hi>It ſhall be an habitation of Dragons, the wild Beaſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart ſhall alſo meet with the wild Beaſt of the Iſland, and the Satyr ſhall cry to his fellow.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi>
18.2. it is ſaid that Satyrs ſhall Dance there.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe <hi>Satyrs</hi> are generally held to be Devils, and <hi>Moſes</hi> here ſays, <hi>The Poyſon of the Serpents of the Duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we know, that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd that Curſe to that Serpent, which was<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45720:87"/>the Devil, <hi>That duſt ſhould be the Serpents meaſ</hi> therefore I look upon theſe Serpents of the Duſt here ſpoken of to be Devils.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 25. v. begins again to ſpeak of the Afflictions of the Natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> for this Song is intermixt with the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and with the Adopted Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> wherein he treats from <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s firſt coming into <hi>Canaan,</hi> to the Deſtruction of the World, and their Reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Natural Seed, he ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.25.
<hi>The ſword without, and Terror within, ſhall deſtroy both the young man and the Virgin, the ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo, with the man of gray hairs.</hi>
26. <hi>I ſaid, I would ſcatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to ceaſe from among men.</hi> 27. <hi>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, leſt their adverſaries ſhould behave themſelves ſtrangely, and leſt they ſhould ſay, our Hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.</hi> 28. <hi>For they are a Nation void of Council, neither is there any underſtanding in them.</hi> 29. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end.</hi> 30. <hi>How ſhould one chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight, except their Rock had ſold them, and the Lord had ſhut them up.</hi> 31. <hi>For their Rock is not as our Rock, even our Enemies themſelves being Judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this part we ſee, is altogether ſpoken of the Natural Seed, by the Judgments that have come upon them. And from the 31. v. to the 36. v. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks again of the Adopted Seed, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:45720:87"/>of which came that Root of Bitterneſs, of which he ſaith in <hi>Deut.</hi>
32.32. <hi>For their Vine is the Vine of Sodom, and the Fields of Gomorrah; Their Grapes are Grapes of Gall, their cluſters are Bitter.</hi> 33.
<hi>Their Wine is the Poyſon of Dragons, and the cruel Venom of Aſps.</hi>
34. <hi>Is not this laid up in ſtore with me, and ſealed up among my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> 35. <hi>To me belongeth Vengeance and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, their foot ſhall ſlide in due time, for the day of their Calamity is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas God ſaid, Is not this laid up in ſtore with me, and Sealed up among my Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whereby we may plainly ſee there was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in theſe words, which was not then to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded. And whereas God ſaith, <hi>To me belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vengeance and recompence.</hi> That is, God will ariſe to Judgment, and then will he render Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and Recompence: Then ſhall thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, with the deceived, know to whom theſe threatned Judgments do belong; For God ſaith, <hi>Their Foot ſhall ſlide in due time:</hi> That is, from their height, grandeur, and greatneſs; For in the next words God ſaith, <hi>The Day of their Calamity is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſte.</hi> And
<hi>Moſes</hi> began again in the 36. v. to ſpeak of the Natural Seed of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> which words of his has their Reference towards the time of
<hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Reſtitution, for he ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now we ſee, that in theſe Verſes are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Judgment, the which is Gods Revenges upon the Enemy, at which time
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore we may clearly ſee that all this is to be fullfill'd at the Reſtitution of all things: For the Land has never been reſtor'd to <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſince the Captivity: Only that
<hi>Judah</hi> had a liberty to build a Temple, and to inhabit in that part that<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45720:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>belonged to them; but notwithſtanding, they were ſubject to another Monarchy So we ſee that all the Scripture doth abſolutely agree in one and the ſame thing: That the Wicked
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> be deſtroyed, and
<hi>Iſrael</hi> reſtored, and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Elect called in; and all this is to be at one and the ſame time. And as you ſee the natural Seed and the Adopted Seed here joyn'd, ſo they are alike joyn'd throughout the Word, where they are ſpoken of; ſo is the Deſtruction of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked World all along ſaid to be at the Time of their Reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In this fore-mentioned Chapter and Song, is not only contained the ſhort Hiſtory of the World, from the time that God brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the time that the Lord ariſeth to Judgment; at which time it is ſaid, from the beginning of revenges upon the Enemy, he will make his Arrows Drunk with Blood, and his Sword ſhall devour Fleſh: And, as it is ſaid, at which time God will have mercy on his Land, and on his People; and then it is, other Nations ſhall Rejoyce with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.41,42,43. By which we ſee that this Song does not only reach to the end of this World, but it launcheth it ſelf forth into the Glorious time. And <hi>David</hi> being a Prophet, and belov'd of God; and thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the ſecrets of God more than the reſt, therefore he cries out of the Wonderful things that is contained in his Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:45720:89"/>Novv were theſe Judgments, that are here ſet down, pronounced againſt the Land of the thirſty Drunkard, with good Liquor, I doubt there would not be much Land left, either in
<hi>Canaan,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> free from theſe Plagues, here ſpecified, as well as <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> for we need not doubt but moſt of the foreſaid Land at one time or other, hath had ſuch owners. But altho the Drunkard that Loves good Liquor, is threatned with the wrath of God, and Hell, yet there is not this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Curſe threatn'd to their Land.</p>
                  <p>And there is nothing in the Word of God that is inſignificant, but hath its time to be made Evident.</p>
                  <p>And now is the near Approach of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration; it being now the time that the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds are gone forth, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.22. <hi>Behold the whirl-wind of the Lord goeih forth with fury; a continual whirl-wind, which ſhall fall with pain upon the Head of the wicked.

                  <p>THis Book being done in haſt, is not ſo well done as it ought to have been; yet therein is made manifeſt, both the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God: And when I Writ this Book, there was a dread ſtood over me, as a Caution, that I ſhould not do the Work of the Lord negligently. And there is but two or three things in it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I did lean to my own underſtanding, or received Opinion, without ſeeking to God concerning it. And ſince, in thoſe things, God by his Word hath made it plain to me, that I was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in them; for I then thought that all that laid hold of the offered Mercy, according as it is tendred in the Goſpel, was alſo termed the Elect, as well as thoſe that were fore-choſen; and ſo then, not reckoned with the World. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I found by the Word, that ſuch were but in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: Neither did I then underſtand that the Chriſtians, when ſpoken of in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> in which they are often mentioned, were all there termed Heathen, both good and bad, which ſince by the Word, I have fully proved in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treatiſe: And likewiſe then I did not ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Lord by the Law and Goſpel, ſpeaks but in a peculiar manner to them that are under it. For the Heathen fall not under the ſame ſevere Condemnation as the wicked Chriſtians will, when the Lord again comes: And therefore no ſuch neceſſity to warn them for the Coming of the Lord, whom they now know not; but they may find Mercy according to the Word. And it is the promiſe of God, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be reſtored when the Lord again comes, as is fully proved in the following Treatiſe, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>As for ſuch as find fault with my quoting of
<hi>Eſdras,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was not mentioned either by Chriſt, or any of the Apoſtles: To which I anſwer, Neither were ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prophets, that are ſpoken of in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> But if any ſay, he is not mentioned there, they aſſert that which is falſe: For
<hi>Ezra</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> is the ſame Perſon, which in the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> is called <hi>Eſdras.</hi> For in <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap.
<hi>10.</hi> the <hi>9, 16, 17.</hi> Verſes, is exactly the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:45720:91"/>with that in <hi>1 Eſdras 9.</hi> Chap. <hi>5, 6, 17.</hi> Verſes. And alſo as in <hi>Nehemian 2.4.</hi> the like is again ſaid in the <hi>1 Eſdras 9.40,42.</hi> By which places, it is fully made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That it was one and the ſame man, who after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity cauſed
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to put away their ſtrange Wives, being met together at
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> on the Twelfth day of the Ninth Month, at which time was the great Showre of Rain. And alſo he ſtood upon a Pulpit of Wood, and Read the Law to all the People on the Firſt day of the Seventh Month. As to the difference of the Name, the one was taken out of the Hebrew, the other out of the Caldean Tongue.</p>
                  <p>But as for our Ancient Expoſitors, who placed not his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies among the Prophets, it was becauſe themſelves erred from the Truth: For they newly coming from under the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Popery, and ſo did not rightly underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for they apprehended that none but the Elect could be ſaved. But now it is fully proved by the Word, that all that are found in obedience, are Heirs to the promiſe, whether Elect, or not Elect. They likewiſe have denied the <hi>Reſtitution of all things, which God by the mouth of all his holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> hath declared, <hi>Acts
3.21.</hi> and ſo likewiſe by <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I Writ this Book, I found there was ſeveral other places in Scripture in controverſie, which was not in this Treatiſe anſwered, which made me defer the finiſhing of it, till ſuch time as God had innabled me to make plain thoſe other places which were in diſpute; which by Gods aſſiſtance I have accompliſhed.</p>

                  <p>IN the firſt place, that which I ſhall ſpeak to is the Words of Chriſt, the which he hath left us to enlighten our Underſtanding in his Word. That is, in that he did joyn the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Deſtruction of the World together. According to which it is ſo joyned by the Prophets; and alſo all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies are joyned and Intermixt.

<hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, by the Deliverance that is to be by Chriſt when he again comes. Now what we know was not fullfilled of the Prophecies, it remains to be fullfilled, and what was not made out in <hi>Davids</hi> and the Prophets ſufferings, was in the ſufferings of Chriſt. And what was not made out in the forementioned Kings, will be fullfilled by the King of Kings, the Lord Chriſt: And what was not fullfilled by his firſt coming, remains to be fullfilled at his ſecond coming. And although all theſe things are in ſome places intermixt, yet in ſome other places they are ſet down more diſtinctly by themſelves: And alſo it is the uſual way of Scripture ſpeaking, to mention things that are to come, as though they were already done, both in the Old and New Teſtament. But the Coming of the Lord, the Deſtruction of the World, and the Reſtoration of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is all along ſaid to be at one and the ſame time, as the following Treatiſe by the Word doth make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo the Enemies of Chriſt joyned with the Enemies of <hi>David;</hi> but we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the one from the other; for he curſeth the Enemies of Chriſt, but prays for his own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45720:94"/>There is alſo the Enemies of the Natural Seed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the Adopted ſeed joyned together.</p>

                  <p>There is alſo the Judgments pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Natural Seed of <hi>Iſr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And alſo with the Frieſts and Shepherds, are included the Goſpel Miniſtrs; but in eſpecial manner by the Shepherds.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe the ſtrangers that were taken in, and thoſe that ſhould be taken in, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like joyned in the ſame Covenant with
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and from the adopted ſeed, did the Root of Gall and Wormwood ariſe.</p>
                  <p>And alſo in the Scripture, the word <hi>All,</hi> doth not ſignify the <hi>whole,</hi> but the <hi>Major part,</hi> as in <hi>Exod.</hi>
9.6. and 18.19. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.17. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.13,14,15.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.28,29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.18.
<hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                  <p>And alſo there is three ſorts of Promiſes, to three ſorts of People. Firſt, there is a general Promiſe to all that will accept of Salvation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conditions as it is tendred. The ſecond ſort is to them that were as a gift from the Father to Chriſt,
<hi>John</hi> 10.29. And the Third is to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the time of Reſtitution of all things.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo figurative ſpeeches, but we have made figurative ſpeeches where there is none; and where the greateſt figurative
<pb facs="tcp:45720:95"/>ſpeeches are, we have made none, which has caſt us into ſo great a miſt of Darkneſs, as now we lie under; for we ought to make nothing a figurative ſpeech, but what we can prove to be ſo by the word; and alſo we muſt put no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation upon any figurative ſpeech, but what we can find another place in the word that is ſo expreſt, that may unfold or open it, and no other Scripture to contradict it.</p>
                  <p>And alſo 'tis the uſual way of Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both in the old and new Teſtament, to mention things that are to come, as tho they were then paſt or preſent.</p>
                  <p>And as to the figurative ſpeeches, I ſhall here ſet down, in this Treatiſe, thoſe figurative ſpeeches, which are moſt ſignificant, yet have been the leaſt taken notice of. As firſt, there is the fabrick of the World, and the World of People, which is far oftner term'd the World in Scripture, than the other is. There is the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Heavens and Earth, and there is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth of Powers and People, which are far oftner ſaid, to be the Heavens and Earth in Holy Writ, than the other are.</p>
                  <p>And as there is the Hoſt of Heaven, the Son, Moon and Stars; and alſo the Principalities and Powers are ſaid to be the Hoſt of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a material City, and a City of People.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſea of Waters and a ſea of People.</p>
                  <p>There is a flood of Waters, and a flood of People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45720:95"/>There is raging Waves of the Sea, and rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Waves of the Sea of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>There is the Animal Beaſts, and the Beaſt of People.</p>
                  <p>There is an Earthly City, and a City that comes down from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>There is a Tabernacle of Man's Pitching, and a Tabernacle which the Lord ſhall pitch, and not Man.</p>
                  <p>There is natural Waters, and ſpiritual Waters.</p>
                  <p>There is the Whirl-wind in the Air, and the Whirl-wind of Afflictions.</p>
                  <p>There is real fire, and figurative fire, which is the Anger of Almighty God. But God, to let us underſtand, that Hell-fire, is as well a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial fire; therefore ſaith, it is a Lake of Fire that burneth with Brimſtone.</p>
                  <p>There is a real ſword, and a figurative ſword.</p>
                  <p>There is a real Vine-yard, and figurative Vine-yard.</p>

                  <p>There is a real <hi>Eſau,</hi> and a figurative

                  </p>
                  <p>There is the real Land of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Land of <hi>Eſauh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a real <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and a figurative

                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo this following Treatiſe gives an Account of three Worlds, three Evers, Three Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<pb facs="tcp:45720:96"/>three Times, three Days.</p>
                  <p>There is the Natural Day, the Day of a Year, and a day of a thouſand Years.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo three ſorts of <hi>Sabbaths</hi> ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The ſeventh Day Sabbath. 2dly. The ſeventh Years Sabbath. 3. The ſeventh, ſeventh Years Sabbath, in which all things were reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their right owners; the which, figures out to us the great Jubile, or Sabbatiſm of Reſt, and Reſtitution of all things by Chriſt, when he again comes: And alſo in the great Jubel Sabbath, there is one thing very remarkable, that is, that the Jubel Year was not fixton the ſeventh, ſeventh Year, the which would have been on the forty ninth year: But leaving the forty ninth year, was placed on the fiftieth year, which ſeems to ſignify the change of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to all when the Lord again comes; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly our eighth Day, otherwiſe called the Firſt Day, is now the Sabbath; for in the fourth Commandment, God ſaith, the ſeventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.

But he ſaith, in 2 Pet. 3.7. <hi>The Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> But you may ſay, why doth St.

<hi>And if one look into the land, behold darkneſs and ſorrow, and the light is darkned in the heavens thereof.</hi> Whereas the Lord ſaith darkneſs in the land; that is, ſorrow and darkneſs among the people of the land.

                  <p>Whereas he tells us, That One Day is with the Lord as a Thouſand Years, and a Thouſand Years as One Day. After which he tells us, the Day of the Lord will come; which is not the Natural Day nor the Artificial Day; the Old World was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in ſuch a Day. Neither did the Ram's Horns blow down <hi>Jericho</hi> in ſuch a Day. But it is that Day which is ſpoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. where it is ſaid, That <hi>God hath appointed a day in which he will<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45720:102"/>judge the world in Righteouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi>

                  <p>But you may ſay, Where will the Thouſand Years Reign be when the Heavens and Earth are burnt up; as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in the
7th Verſe of the forementioned Chapter. Pray forget not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſaying, wherein he tells us, <hi>The Heavens and Earth which are now, God hath reſerved unto fire;</hi> For thoſe that were in the Old World, thoſe ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, as then ſo now the being of Heaven and Earth at the Reſtitution, or in the world to come, or <hi>New Jeruſalem-ſtate,</hi> only they will appear more illuſtrious, when the darkſome Clouds are diſperſed; and then the Earth will be renewed to that Perfection, as it was in the firſt Creation. But as to the Heavens which are now, whereof St
<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, his meaning is, the Principalities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are carrying on the Rule of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World; and by the Earth, the meaner ſort, which are filling up their meaſure of Iniquity, the which the Old World did admit of no ſuch dſtinction in it. And alſo by the Heavens is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the Teachers, and thoſe that ſhould have been the Teachers of the Word; for if they are called Gods to whom the Word of God came; as in <hi>John</hi> 10.35. why not thoſe called Heavens, to whom the Word of God was entruſted to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the World withal. And as our Lord ſaith to his Diſciples, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Ye are the Light of the world.</hi> And in the book called, <hi>The Teſtaments of the Twelve Patriarchs,</hi> which they ſpake to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before their Death; wherein <hi>Levi,</hi> in his laſt Charge to his Sons, tells them, They be the Light of the Heavens, as the Sun and the Moon. And he ſaid unto them,
<hi>What ſhall all the Heathen do, if you<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45720:103"/>be over darkned with wickedneſs, and bring Curſedneſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Countryfolk, for whoſe ſake the Light of the world is put into you, to enlighten all men withal; This Light of the world ſhall you moſt willfully ſteal, and teach Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contrary to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> Here, by all this you ſee, that thoſe to whom the word of God is committed, are term'd the Light of the World, and the Light of the Heaven, as the Sun and Moon. And as for the Elements, we know that man's body is made up of the Four Elements. Now St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his way of ſpeaking, doth make it a figurative Speech, as to the burning the Heavens and Earth. And when we can bring ſeveral places out of holy Writ, to prove it to be ſo, and places of Scripture to prove our aſſertion, then we go upon good grounds; but when we make figurative Speeches, or Allegories, where there is none, and where there is; for them to make an Aſſertion of that which they cannot bring good Proof for out of the Word, is of very dangerous conſequence; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. <hi>wreſt the Scripture to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> But this of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is eaſily proved a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Speech, not only by his own manner of ſpeaking, but alſo by the Three Evangeliſts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord makes no mention of the burning of the Heavens and Earth when he comes to judge the World. Nor St. <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.14. mentions not any ſuch thing as to the burning of them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is there any mention made of their being deſtroy'd at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord; Nor doth any other place of the Bible ſpeak of their being burnt, but St. <hi>Peter.</hi> And whereas the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> makes mention of fire, it is to ſet forth the fierce Anger of the Lord againſt ſinners: For as there is nothing ſo terrible to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as fire; ſo there can be nothing ſo inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45720:103"/>as the Anger of the Almighty Lord; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid, in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>to come in flaming fire to take Vengeance on them that know not God, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the Gospel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The weight of Whoſe Anger being more intolerable than we are able to imagine it. Therefore God ſaith, Jer. 23.29. <hi>Is not my Word like as a fire, ſaith the Lord, and like a Hammer that breaketh the Rocks in peices?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore it is a uſual Phraſe in Scripture, to expreſs the Anger of the Almighty God by Fire, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.18. where God himſelf ſaith, <hi>with the Fire of my Jealouſie.</hi> And it is ſaid of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.24. That <hi>he is a conſuming Fire:</hi> That is, he is an unreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. And as the Thorns cannot reſiſt the Powerful Flames, neither can we his ireful Judgments when he doth inflict them on the ſinner. And here, had St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the plain Letter of the Word, pronounc'd thoſe Judgments againſt the Powers and People, the then preſent Age could not have born it; neither indeed the ſucceeding Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And as for the Beaſt, or Pope, he found ſo much in the Scriptures againſt himſelf, and his Crew, that he made it Death for the Laity to read them, that thereby his Falſhood and Villany might remain undiſcovered to the people.</p>
                  <p>Now the Pope did not riſe, till ſeveral hundred years after the Apoſtles. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2,3.
<hi>Declareth, that the day of the Lord ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition. v.</hi> 4. <hi>Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped, ſo that he is as God, ſitting in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. v.</hi> 9,10,11,12.
<hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of</hi> Satan, <hi>with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonder. v.</hi> 10. <hi>And<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45720:104"/>with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> 11. <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lit.</hi> 12. <hi>That they all might be damned who believe, not the truth, but have pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which we may plainly ſee, that God never leaves a people, till ſuch time as they forſake him, by taking pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to what hath been ſaid of the Beaſt, and the ſeven hill'd City, and of the Reign of the Beaſt, has been in a figurative way; For the Pope's Deſign, with his Crew, being wholly to deceive, the Will of God is, that they might be deceived. And it is ſaid in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. when the Beaſt aroſe, <hi>The Dragon gave him his power, and his Seat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> And now, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. he oppoſeth, <hi>and exalteth himſelf above all that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, or that is worſhipped. So that he is as God, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> And now he ſitting in the Temple of God; and takes the Power of a God to him, in that he ſaith, the revealed will of God is no farther to be accounted of than to what he approves of in it. And alſo he, with his pretended Keys, lets into Heaven thoſe whom God by his Word ſhuts out, and them out of Heaven whom God by his Word permits in. Thus they are filling up their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they may come to their deſerved end. And little better ſucceſs muſt no Sect, or Church expect, that has uſed the Word of God deceitfully; nor their hypocritical Hearers. As for this <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Countries adjoyning to it, is figured our to us in the former <hi>Idumea,</hi> or <hi>Edom,</hi> For
<hi>Eſau</hi> looking on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the Elder brother, therefore his Envy was always towards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> although he ſinfully and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45720:104"/>did ſell his Birthright unto ſhis Brother, in the time he was diſtreſſed, being faint for want of Food; he then ſaid, if I die for hunger, what good then will this birth right do me. And ſo not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the promiſes of God, and therefore in the day of tryal parted with his birthright for a meſs of pottage. And almoſt all this world being like unto him, that in the day of tryal, either for ſome luſt, or ſome profit, or to deliver themſelves out of ſome trouble, they part with the bleſſing which God in Chriſt has promiſ'd, which is eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they walk according to the rule God has ſet before them. And ſo for theſe uncertain, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary injoyments, like <hi>Eſau,</hi> embrace this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world. And when the time comes for the righteous to inherit the bleſſing, theſe worldlings will then like <hi>Eſau</hi> be rejected, although they may then ſeek the bleſſing earneſtly with tears, as he did, yet was rejected. But as it is in our days, the more emptineſs and want of knowledge, the more pride and malice. So was it with the ſeed of <hi>Eſau,</hi> for it is ſaid of him in <hi>Obed.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 3.4,8,10. <hi>The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee: Thou that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in the clefts of the Rock, whoſe habitation is high, that ſaith in his heart, who ſhall bring me down to the ground?</hi> 4. <hi>Tho thou exalt thy ſelf as the</hi> Eagle,
<hi>and the thou ſet thy neſt among the</hi> Stats, <hi>thence will I bring thee down, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>Shall I not in that day, ſaith the Lord, even deſtroy the wiſe men out of</hi> Edom, <hi>and underſtanding out of the mount of</hi> Eſau? Verſe. 10. <hi>For thy Violence againſt the Brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhame ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever.</hi> And Jer. 49. from ver. 7. to v. 23. gives us much the ſame account of them. And as the two forementioned Prophets did treat of the real <hi>Eſau,</hi> or <hi>Idumea,</hi> ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> dothof the figurative one; and alſo of<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45720:105"/>thoſe wicked Powers that are carrying on the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World with him. And here <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. 34.4,10. doth fully make out the meaning of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where he here terms the Powers, or Rulers, to be the Hoſt of Heaven; where in Verſe 4. he ſaith, <hi>All the Hoſt of Heaven ſhall be diſſolved, and the Heavens ſhall be rolled together as a Scrole, and all their Hoſts ſhall fall down as the Leaf falleth from the Vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.</hi> Now as to the Hoſt of Heaven, his meaning here cannot be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the 10th Verſe of the ſame Chapter, he makes mention of Day and Night, and many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations after theſe Heavens here ſpoken of were deſtroyed. But whereas the Prophet mentions the Hoſt of Heaven ſhall be diſſolved; his meaning is, without doubt, that their Power ſhall be taken from them, as Kings do from their Parliaments that are diſſolved by them. And in the next place he ſaith, the Heavens ſhall be rolled together as a Scrole, or faſtened together, till they receive their ſentence of Judgment. After which they fell down, as a leaf falleth from the Vine, and a falling fig from the fig tree.</p>
                  <p>By which, methinks, there is a ſuitable Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Soul, as the leaf to the fire, and the body as the rotten fig to the Dunghil. And in the 5th Verſe of the ſame Chapter, the Lord ſaith, <hi>My Sword ſhall be bathed in Heaven; behold it ſhall come down upon</hi> Idumea, <hi>and upon the people of my Curſe to Judgment.</hi> Verſe 6.
<hi>The Sword of the Lord is fill'd with Blood, and is made f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And this Prophet, further declaring their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaith in the 7th Verſe, <hi>And the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns ſhall come down with them, and the Bullocks with the Bulls, and their Land ſhall be ſoaked with Blood, and their duſt made fat with fatneſs: for it is the day of the Lord's Vengeance and the year of Recompence for the Controverſie of</hi> Sion. 9.

And God hath given us further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.6,7,8,11,12. where he ſaith,
<hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon the Walls; O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſhall never hold their peace day nor night; Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence.</hi> 7. <hi>And give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth.</hi> 8. <hi>The Lord hath ſworn by his right hand, by the arm of his ſtrength, Surely, I will no more give thy Corn to be meat for thine Enemies: and the Sons of the ſtrangers ſhall not drink thy Wine for which thou haſt laboured.</hi> 11.
<hi>Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world, Say ye unto the Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>behold thy Salvation cometh, behold his reward is with him, and his work before him.</hi> 12. <hi>And they ſhall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord; and thou ſhalt be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſought out; a City not forſaken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now firſt, in the 6th Verſe, the Lord tells them, That he hath ſet Watchmen upon thy Walls, O <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Which ſhall never hold their Peace; and the Saints that are of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, as it is ſaid in Rev. 6.9. <hi>They cry, Lord, haw long?</hi> In the next place that followeth, is a ſpecial Command to all that make mention of the Lord, not to keep ſilence, and that we ſhould give him no reſt, until he eſtabliſh, and make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a praiſe. A praiſe: Where? The Lord hath ſaid, in the Earth. And in Verſe 8. the Lord hath ſworn to<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45720:107"/>them by his Right Hand, and by the Arm of his Strength: the which is, by the Greatneſs of his Power; That he will give no more their Corn to be meat for their Enemies; and that the Sons of Strangers ſhall no more drink the Wine for the which they have laboured. Theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we ſee, are not yet made good to them; and therefore doth remain to be fullfill'd to them; for that God that cannot Lie, hath ſworn it.</p>
                  <p>And that this is to be perform'd on Earth, is evident, in as much as there is not Corn and Wine to be ſowed and reaped in Heaven. Now when this ſhall be, the Lord tells us in the 11th Verſe; for there the Lord hath Ordered Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made to the End of the World, thereby to let us know, that their Reſtoration is not to be in this our World; for it is not there ſaid, That the Lord hath proclaimed it to the Ends of the World, but to the End of this World. <hi>Say to the Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>behold thy Salvation cometh, and his Reward is with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is evident, that when the Lord did firſt come, that they had not ſalvation, and that his Reward was not with him, nor their City reſtored to them. And therefore the Lord tells them in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. where ſpeaking of his Second Coming to judge the World, he telleth them in the 24th Verſe, <hi>That Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the Times of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be fullfilled.</hi> That is, not till the Time of the Gentiles be accompliſhed. And therefore the Lord in <hi>Luke</hi> 4. read no more of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. than<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45720:108"/>what did belong to
<hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time. Which being the firſt Verſe of that Chapter in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which is the 18th Verſe of the forementioned Chapter in
<hi>Luke;</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the poor; he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Captives, and the recovery of ſight to the blind, to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed:</hi> 19. <hi>And to preach the acceptable Year of the Lord.</hi> 20.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Lord at this time was ſent to preach Deliverance, or to foretell the Deliverance of the Captives, and he was ſent to recover the ſight of the blind; and by whom the blind Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were enlightned; and to ſet at liberty thoſe that were bruiſed (or bound, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> hath it); That is, bound by Satan through the darkneſs of Error;

<hi>Sion</hi>'s Comfort. And whereas St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and a New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> This hath its ſpecial Reference to the New Ruling Powers, which are the raiſed Saints, which are here termed the Heavens, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.

30th Chapter, informs us how the Excellency of the Heavens and Earth will appear; in ver. 25. he ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be upon every high Mountain, and upon every high Hill, Rivers and Streams of Waters, in the Day of the great ſlaughter, when the Towers fall.</hi> 26. <hi>Moreover, the Light of the Moon ſhall be as the Light of the Sun, and the Light of the Sun ſhall be ſevenfold, as the Light if the ſeven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound.</hi> Now he here tells us again, when the Earth is to be ſo repleniſhed, or renewed, that it is in the day of the great ſlaughter, when the Towers fall. He alſo tells us, That it is the Day in which the Lord will bind up the breach of his People, and heal the ſtroke of their wound. And then will the Light of the Moon be as the Light of the Sun, and the Light of the Sun ſhall be ſevenfold, as the Light of Seven Days. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.27,28,29,30,31.
<hi>Behold, the Name of the Lord cometh from far, burning with his Anger, and the burden thereof is heavy, his Lips are full of Indignation, and his Tongue as a devouring fire.</hi> 28. <hi>And his Breath an overflowing ſtream, ſhall reach to the midſt of the Neck, to ſift the Nations with the Sive of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and there ſhall be a bridle in the jaws of the people cauſing them to err.</hi> Becauſe they have no delight in the waies of the Lord, therefore they will be ſnared, that they may be taken. 29. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall have a Song in the night, as when a holy ſolemnity is kept, and gladneſs of heart, as when one <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45720:109"/>goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the Lord to the mighty one of</hi> Iſrael.
30. <hi>And the Lord ſhall cauſe his glorious voice to be heard, and ſhall ſhew the lighting down of his arm, with the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with ſcattering and tempeſt.</hi> 31. <hi>for through the voice of the Lord ſhall the</hi> Aſſirian <hi>be beaten down which ſmote with a rod.</hi> By the
<hi>Aſſirian</hi> here, is comprehended <hi>Iſraels</hi> enemies which now holds them in bondage, as the <hi>Aſſirian</hi> did formerly. And
<hi>Iſa.</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the 29 Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 5, &amp;c. <hi>Moreover, the multitude of thy ſtrangers ſhall be like the ſmall duſt, and the multitude of thy terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones ſhall be as chaff that paſſes away: Yea, it ſhall be at an inſtant ſuddenly. v.</hi> 6.
<hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of Hoſts with Thunder, and with Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and great noiſe, with ſtorm and Tempeſt, and Flame of devouring fire. v.</hi> 7. <hi>And the multitude of all the Nations that fight againſt</hi> Ariel, <hi>even all that fight againſt her and her munition, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs her, ſhall be as a dream of a night viſion. v.</hi>
8. <hi>And it ſhall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth, but he awaketh, and his Soul is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Or as when a thirſty man dreameth, and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his Soul hath appetite: So ſhall the multitude of all the Nations be, that fight againſt mount</hi> Sion. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Stay your ſelves and wonder. Cry ye out, and cry, they are drunken, but not with wine, they ſtagger, but not with ſtrong drink, v.</hi> 10. <hi>For the Lord hath poured out upon you the Spirit of deep Sleep, and hath cloſed your eyes; the Prophets and your Rulers, and Seers hath he covered.</hi> 11. <hi>v. And the Viſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45720:110"/>of all is become unto you, as the words of a Book that is ſealed, which when men deliver to one that is learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, read this, I pray thee, and he ſaith, I cannot, for it is ſealed. v.</hi> 12. <hi>And the book is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him that is not Learned, ſaying read this I pray thee, and he ſaith, I am not Learned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now of certain this Scripture doth in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, point to us Chriſtians that are now in the latter day; for the beginning of the Chapter treats of the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> And the 5. v. downward, ſpeaks of the Deſtruction of the World, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> Enemies, with the extraordinary Stupidity that they ſhould then lie under. And the Prophet in v. 11. hath hinted it fully to us. Wherein he tells us the viſion of all is become as a book that is ſealed. That is, wherein is comprehended the deſtruction of the world, the reſtoration of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and the Glory of Chriſts Kingdom. And <hi>Iſa.</hi> Saith in the 65. Chap. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>For ſaith the Lord, Behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: And the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind. v.</hi> 18. <hi>But be you glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: For behold, I create</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a rejoycing, and her people a joy.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may ſee plainly, that this new heavens and earth will be at the reſtoration of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And in the 19th Verſe, the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in Jeruſalem, and joy in my people, and the Voice of weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</hi> V. 20. <hi>There ſhall be no more thence an Infant of Days, nor an Old Man that hath<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45720:110"/>not fill'd his Days; for the Child ſhall die an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years old, but the ſinner being an hundred Years old, ſhall be accurſed.</hi> V. 21. <hi>And they ſhall build Houſes, and inhabit them, and they ſhall plant Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and eat the Fruit of them.</hi> V. 22.
<hi>They ſhall not build, and another inhabit, they ſhall not plant, and another eat; for as the days of a Tree, are the days of my People, and my elect ſhall long injoy the work of their hands.</hi> V. 23. <hi>They ſhall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble: for they are the Seed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off-ſpring with them. v.</hi> 24. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer, and whileſt they are yet a ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> Now we muſt not take this ſinner here ſpoken of neither to be in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but of ſome of thoſe Nations that were ſaved, which afterwards their Seed may fall off. For in <hi>Jer.</hi>
31.33,34,35,36,37,38,40. There is the Covenant ſet down that the Lord will make with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in Ver. 31,33. <hi>After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people. v.</hi> 34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, know ye the Lord: For they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: For I will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their ſins no more. v.</hi> 35. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the Ordinances of the Moon and of the Stars for a light by night, which divideth the Sea<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45720:111"/>when the waves thereof roar, the Lord of Hoſts is his Name.</hi> V. 36. <hi>If thoſe Ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the Seed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>alſo ſhall ceaſe from being a Nation before me for ever.</hi> V. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, if Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove can be meaſured, and the foundations of the earth ſearched out beneath; I will alſo caſt off all the Seed of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for all that they have done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> V. 38. <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, and the City ſhall be built to the Lord; from the Tower of Hananiel, unto the gate of the Corner.</hi> V. 40. <hi>And the whole valley of the dead Bodies, and the Aſhes, and all the Fields un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Brook Kidron, unto the corner of the Horſe-Gate toward the Eaſt, ſhall be holy unto the Lord, it ſhall not be plucks up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith, behold the days come that the City ſhall be built. Now the Lord does not here ſay, the day is come, but the days come by which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the days of two thouſand years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; and then their City ſhall be built, for it is ſaid, a thouſand year is with the Lord, as one day; and therefore the Lord ſpeaking in many places of things that are to come; as tho they were preſent. Of which Divine <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hartus,</hi> ſpeaking of God, ſaith, that his mighty Voice ſpeaks in the midſt of thunder, cauſing the Rocks to Rock, and Hills to Tear, calling the things that are not, as tho they were. Now what is ſpoken of this City, of certain is not<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45720:111"/>ment of that which was built, at the return out of the <hi>Babilonian</hi> Captivity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the dimentions of it is far larger than ever
<hi>Jeruſalem was</hi> yet built.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That this <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be called Holy unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It ſhall not be pluckt up, nor thrown down, any more for ever. And therefore it is to be rebuilt at the reſtitution of all things. At which time, all theſe wonderful promiſes ſhall be made good to
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> And the Lord alſo ſaith in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.37.
<hi>Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury and in great wrath, and I will bring them again into this place, and cauſe them to dwell ſafely.</hi> 38. <hi>And they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God.</hi> 39. <hi>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their Children after them.</hi> 40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> 41. <hi>Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this Land aſſuredly, with my whole heart, and with my whole Soul,</hi> Jer. 33.14. <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will perform that good thing which I have promiſed unto the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and to the houſe of</hi> Judah. 15. <hi>In thoſe days, and at that time I will cauſe the branch of righteouſneſs to grow up unto</hi> David, <hi>and he ſhall execute Judgment and righteouſneſs in the Land.</hi> 16. <hi>In thoſe days<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45720:112"/>ſhall</hi> Judah
<hi>be ſaved, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely.</hi> Here you ſee in thoſe forementioned verſes is contained Gods everlaſting covenant with <hi>Iſrael</hi> after they are again re-eſtabliſh'd, they ſhall never more be caſt off: Whereby we ſee they ſtand with greater ſecurity then our firſt parents did in paradice. And therefore the making good of theſe promiſes muſt be at the reſtitution of all things. At which time they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and his brother, but that they then ſhall be all taught of God, from the leaſt of them, to the greateſt of them. And God alſo tells them in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.21.
<hi>Thy people ſhall be all righteous: They ſhall inherit the Land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> 22. <hi>A little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one, a ſtrong Nation: I the Lord will haſten it in its time.</hi> And it is ſaid in <hi>v.</hi> 14. of the ſame Chap. <hi>The Sons alſo of them that afflicted thee, ſhall come bending unto thee, and all they that deſpiſe thee ſhall bow themſelves down at the Soles of thy Feet, and they ſhall call thee the City of the Lord, the</hi> Sion <hi>of the holy one of</hi> Iſrael. Now whereas God ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that he that is left in</hi> Sion, <hi>and he that remaineth in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſhall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in</hi> Jeruſalem. Now by theſe words it does appear to have its meaning at the coming of the Lord, that thoſe that then are found written among the living, ſhall there continue alive and remain in
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45720:112"/>which will be as it is inhabited with ſeveral ſorts of people. And the words that are in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſe makes it ſo out, where 'tis ſaid. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>and ſhall have purged the blood of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>from the midſt thereof, by the Spirit of Judgment, and by the Spirit of burning. v.</hi> 5. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and upon all her aſſemblies a cloud, and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence. v.</hi> 6. <hi>And there shall be a Tabernacle for a shadow in the the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from the ſtorm and from the rain.</hi> By theſe following words you ſee, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not then purged from her filthineſs: when the Lord ſaid they ſhould be called holy that were written among the living in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there may then be ſome <hi>Achan</hi> in the <hi>Camp</hi> of
<hi>Judah,</hi> the which may be taken off before they come to their glorious ſettlement, as never to be caſt out of the favour of God any more; over whom God hath promis'd there ſhould be this glory that is before mention'd, a Tabernacle for a ſhadow to them in the day time from the heat, and for a covert from the ſtorm and from the rain. Of which Tabernacle I ſhall ſpeak more to hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is in ſome places of Scripture ſet down the firſt coming of the Lord with his ſecond coming, whereby it hath made thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures appear more dark to the Reader; but it is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45720:113"/>no other than as the Kingdom of Chriſt is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt in ſeveral places of the Pſalms, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, with the Kingdom of
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> and whilſt ſome lie poring on theſe places, they leave Twenty, nay, many more clear Texts of Scripture unregarded; whereas they ſhould look in all places to the Scriptures way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But I muſt needs own, that a falſe receiv'd Opinion, does mightily blind the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And alſo in that it is the ordinary way of Scripture ſpeaking, both in the Old and New Teſtament, of things that are decreed ſhall be done, to mention them as though they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done; the which does ſomething darken the meaning of it to the Reader. But the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, looking on all things that he has determined to be done in time, to be as though it were already done. But when we find it hath not been done, it remains ſure and certain to us that it will be done, being promiſed by that God and Lord that cannot lie. Neither will he perform his promiſe unto us by the halves. But when I conſider the Strong Promiſes of God to
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> even to both the Houſes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which are ſcattered through the Face of the whole Earth, that he will again reſtore them; and that all theſe wonderful Bleſſings ſhall be then made good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in their own Land, and to their Children after them; and that they ſhould have all the good things of this Life, and that in ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner: And alſo God having promiſed an Everlaſting Covenant with them, that he<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45720:113"/>will never depart from them, nor leave them to depart from him; and that the City ſhall be built upon her own Heap, and that they ſhould continue a Nation upon the Earth as long as the Sun and Moon endureth. And in that theſe things are ſet down in ſo many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they ſhould be made good to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as at the day of the great ſlaughter, when the Towers fall; when a Nation ſhall be born at once; and at the End of this World: And when there is a New Heaven and Earth; all which will be when the Lord comes to judge the World in the Valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat.</hi> Having theſe plain places of Scripture, it ſtrikes me with Aſtoniſhment to think with what Darkneſs we have read them. But whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. <hi>That Fleſh and Blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> It is true, Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom, which is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens: Neither, as it is here ſaid, can Corruption inherit Incorruption; which is, Fleſh and Blood, with its corrupt Affections and Luſt, cannot inherit the Kingdom of Chriſt; which then will be made like to <hi>Eden,</hi> the Garden of God, as it is ſaid in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. no more than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> could enjoy Paradice after he had ſinned; But as for Fleſh and Blood, we know he had it in the firſt Creation: but it was his ſin made him obnoxious to God, for which he was caſt out of Paradice. But <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will be paſt that danger, through the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45720:114"/>Covenant that God will then make with them, when they are made partakers of the Glory that ſhall be revealed. And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of the Dead, ſaith, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42,43,44. <hi>So alſo is the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead; It is ſown in corruption, it is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power.</hi> 44. <hi>It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body.</hi> Now the Apoſtle tells us, that this great Change, in Verſe 52. <hi>will be in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, at the laſt Trump, for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed.</hi> 53. <hi>For this corruption muſt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this mortal muſt put on Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> 54. <hi>So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in Victory.</hi> 45. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting! O Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi> 56. <hi>The ſting of Death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law.</hi> 57. <hi>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We ſee there is no other rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here, but them that truly ſing, O Death, where is thy Sting! O Grave, where is thy Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory! Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13,14,15,16. <hi>I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</hi> 14. <hi>For<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45720:114"/>if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi> 15. <hi>For this we ſay unto you, by the Word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep.</hi> 16. <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Archangel, and the Trump of God: and the dead in Chriſt shall riſe firſt.</hi> 17.
<hi>Then we which are alive, and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo shall we be ever with the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15.51,52. <hi>We shall not ſleep, but we shall all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, at the laſt Trump; for the Trumpet shall ſound, and the dead shall be raiſed incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</hi> Here he ſaith, we ſhall all be changed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinkling of an Eye, at the laſt Trump. Now in theſe words the wicked are not included; for they are never numbered with the righteous. And it is ſaid, When Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, the wicked ſhall be ſlain by the Sword that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord; and that all Fowls were filled with their Fleſh; as in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.21. Therefore not changed, becauſe they then knew a temporal Death, as well as a ſpiritual. Therefore by this word <hi>we all,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth only include thoſe that were to bear their Teſtimony to the Truth, as the firſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did, and as the <hi>Vaudois</hi> have remained a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Standing Witneſs to the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:45720:115"/>If by this Change here ſpoken of, he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude alſo at that moment, an Immortal Change, then it doth appear to be none but the Witneſſes that are ſaid to lie in the Street of the Great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That is, they are compaſſed about with their Enemies; of them it is ſaid, They aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in a Cloud, and their Enemies beheld them, as in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.12. They being choſe for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tabernacle, as the firſt Churches were. For it does appear, that all that are raiſed, are not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Glorious Tabernacle, as I ſhall elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where prove. And alſo when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, and that of the firſt of the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> they were in a continual expectation of the coming of Chriſt, inſomuch that they thought he would return in their Day. But when St. <hi>Paul</hi> by further Revelation, found that the coming of Chriſt would not be ſo ſudden, he then acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church therewith; as in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.2,3. <hi>That ye be not ſoon shaken in mind, nor be troubled, neither by Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter, as from us, though the Day of Chriſt were at hand.</hi> 3. <hi>Let no man deceive you by any means; for that Day shall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the Son of Perdition.</hi> Now by what is here ſaid, it is evident, that the Lord was daily expected of them, till after this time, that the Apoſtle acquainted them with the contrary. Now that there will be a Spiritual Change upon all the Elect, when Chriſt comes, is certain, by all the New Covenant Promiſes: And alſo <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſaith, chap. 6.26. And the men<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45720:115"/>that are received, ſhall ſee it, <hi>who have not taſted Death from their birth; and the heart of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſhall be changed, and turned into an other meaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaid in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.40. <hi>Then ſhall two be in the Field, the one ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and the other left; two women ſhall be grinding at the Mill, the one ſhall be taken and the other left;</hi> but he does not here tell us how. But in Verſe 31. he ſaith,
<hi>He ſhall ſend his Angels with a great Sound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the Four winds.</hi> But the Lord ſaith nothing in the Three Evangeliſts, of their being caught up in the Clouds; but only, <hi>where the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> Now this gathering together from the Four Winds, doth comprehend all the Elect, that will be upon the Earth at Chriſt's coming. As the faithful Chriſtians, whom the Lord ſhall ſo find, and the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thoſe other promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elect, whom the Lord will call in with them. Now into theſe Four Winds was <hi>Judah, Levy,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſcattered. And from theſe Four Winds will the Lord gather them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Ten Tribes, they will come out of one place, as in
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 13. where it is ſaid, they went into a far Countrey, where never man dwelt. Verſe 45. <hi>For through that Countrey there was a great way to go, namely, of a Year and an half, and the ſame Region is called</hi> Arſareth. <hi>Then dwelt they there until the latter time.</hi> Which in the fore part of the Chapter is when Chriſt<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45720:116"/>comes. Now in that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpake of theſe things darkly, it was becauſe there was a Secret in it, which by this manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, it has remain'd veil'd to us, that the calling in of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be at his ſecond coming. At which time all the wicked Chriſtians will be caſt out; for as there was a ſecret under the Law, that was veiled from the
<hi>Jews;</hi> ſo this has been a ſecret vail'd under the Goſpel from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were comprehended under the Elect. And by the Heavens and Earth that are to be deſtroyed, is meant the wicked Powers and People; and then will the material Earth be reſtored and renewed. And whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.31. <hi>In that day, he which shall be upon the Houſe top, and his ſtuff in the Houſe, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the Field, let him likewiſe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back. Remember</hi> Lot<hi>'s wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the will of the Lord is ſuch, that all his ſhould by his word, and the ſigns, be inlightned of his coming. And the Lord here gives warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they ſhould not hanker at that day after their ſtuff. So as to ſetch any thing out of the houſe, by which words it doth appear, they might have knowledge, they ſhould uſe ſuch things, but that they ſhould not then regard them, but to keep on praying till they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the danger by the Angels, as <hi>Lot</hi> was out of <hi>Sodom.</hi> And that we ſhould not be unmindful ſo to do, we have given us the ſad remembrance of <hi>Lots</hi> wife. This warning is<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45720:116"/>only to the believers, for them that believe not, and them that have not the word, it ſignifies nothing to them. Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the promiſed Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.6. That they ſhall be brought to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> otherways, as upon Horſes, Camels, Litters, and the like; and theſe are ſaid to come in multitudes, and to bring their Silver and Gold with them. But Chriſt ſaith of the others,
<hi>there shall be two in one bed, the one shall be taken, the other left, two grinding at the mill, one taken and the other left. Luke.</hi> 17.44,45. That is, the true Chriſtians muſt be thus tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and the Elect being all gathered to the holy Land, but the wicked are left to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thoſe dreadful Judgments, which the Lord will pour upon the Earth after he comes. As in <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> Now there was a neceſſity of a ſecreſy in theſe things, as to the Heavens and Earth, and of the calling in of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Chriſts ſecond coming. And the Lord foreſeeing that the apprehenſions of the ſuddenneſs of his again coming, would be a means to keep the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in obedience to him, and love and affection one to the other, and from being greedy of the lucre of this world, but that they ſhould alwaies live, as waiting for their change; for the Lord foretold us, that when they ſhould begin to think he delayed his coming, they would then eat and drink with the drunken, and ſmite their fellow Servants, which in a dreadful manner they have already done, but the Lord after his Aſcenſion gave to St. <hi>John</hi> a certain knowledg of his return, which was comprehended under two<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45720:117"/>Heads, The time of the Witneſſes Propheſying, and the Beaſts Reigning. For the Lord ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 11.3. <hi>I will give Power to my two witneſſes, and they shall Prophecy a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days cloathed in ſackcloth.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. There is mention made of the Beaſt, to whom the Devil gave Power, and he was to continue forty and two Months.</p>
                  <p>Now by this Beaſt it doth not only appear to be the Pope, but alſo it may be meant by the firſt great Councils that did Afflict the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now the Witneſſes Propheſying a thouſand two hundred and ſixty days cloathed in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, is exactly the two and forty Month the Beaſt is to Reign. For two and forty Months Reckoning thirty days to a Month, according to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Account, it doth juſt amount to one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days of years, at which time the Lord will come; and then the Beaſt ſhall be taken and caſt alive into a Lake burning with Fire and Brimſtone, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil bound up, and then will be the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks, in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. <hi>And I ſaw Thrones, and they that ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I ſaw the Souls of them that were beheaded for the witneſſes of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhiped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with</hi> Chriſt <hi>a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</hi> 5. <hi>But the reſt of the Dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed; this is the firſt Reſurrection.</hi> V. 6. <hi>Bleſſed and Holy is he that hath
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45720:117"/>part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſecond Death hath no Power, but they ſhall be prieſts of God and of Chriſt, and shall reign with him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years,</hi> It is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
1.26. where God telleth them, <hi>I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the beginning, afterward thou shalt be called the City of Righteouſneſs, the Faithful City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pray mark the Words: Here the Lord doth not tell them, that they ſhould have ſuch Judges as they had at the firſt, and ſuch Counſellors as they had at the beginning, but that the Lord would reſtore them Judges that they had at the firſt, and thoſe Counſellors which were at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> in
<hi>Chap.</hi> 12.13. <hi>But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou ſhalt reſt, and ſtand in thy Lot at the end of the days.</hi> Now the Lord, in the fore part of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tells him of the end of the world, and what ſhall then happen; and alſo tells him, that he ſhall reſt, and ſtand in his Lot at the End of the Days. Here the Lord doth not tell him, that he ſhall ſtand in his Lot at the End of his Days, but at the End of the Days after he has reſted; which is at the Reſurrection. By this of
<hi>Daniel</hi> it doth further clear to us the firſt Reſurrection, on whom the ſecond Death ſhall have no Power; but that they ſhall be Prieſts of God and Chriſt, and reign with him a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, Chap. 24.23. <hi>Then the Moon ſhall be confounded, and the Sun aſhamed, when the<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45720:118"/>Lord of Hoſts ſhall reign in Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem,
<hi>and before his Ancients gloriouſly.</hi> Not that Chriſt and his Saints ſhall reign no longer than the Thouſand Years; but that the Viſible Glory may not ſo eminently appear among them after Satan is looſed, that thereby he may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his final Overthrow, when he has deceived his <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak more to in another place.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Angel ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.6. <hi>That there should be time no longer.</hi> That is, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time for this wicked World to have Power and time of Repentance; for their time ſhould be no longer: But there will be a glorious Time for the People of God, in the renewed Heavens and Earrh, when the Lord reigneth. And as there will be another World, ſo another Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and another Time. Of which times the Lord ſaith in
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 9.6. <hi>The Times alſo of the Higheſt, have plain beginnings in wonders, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful workings, and endings in Effects and Signs.</hi> The Lord grant that we may be awakened by the Signs of the End; which End is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>John, Martha</hi> ſaid to the Lord concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her brother, chap. 11.24. <hi>Martha ſaid unto him, I know that he shall riſe again in the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at the laſt day.</hi> The which laſt Day is the laſt day of this wicked World, and when this World ſhall be judged. For the Saints are raiſed before the Wicked are condemned. Therefore by this laſt day muſt be meant the laſt day of their<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45720:118"/>Time. For to take it otherwiſe it cannot be; for it is ſaid, when this World is paſt, that Day and Night laſteth for ever and for ever; as in
<hi>Revelations,</hi> where the Devil receives his Laſt Judgment; he is there ſaid to be caſt into Hell, to be tormented day and night for ever and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The ſame is ſaid of God, That he liveth for ever and for ever,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 4.9. And as to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in 1
<hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>VVhich is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Token of the Righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which ye alſo ſuffer.</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>Seeing it is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing with God to recompence Tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi> 7. <hi>And to you that are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels.</hi> 8. <hi>In flaming fire, taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 9. <hi>VVho ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> 10. <hi>VVhen he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas he ſaith, counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which they did alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. In anſwer to which it is ſaid, in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of our God, and of his Chriſt, and he shall reign for ever and ever.</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>Saying, we give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come, becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power, and haſt reigned.</hi> Verſe 18.<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45720:119"/>
                     <hi>And the Nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they should be judged, and that thou shouldeſt give reward unto thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets, and to the Saints, and them that fear thy Name, ſmall and great, and shouldeſt deſtroy them which deſtroy the Earth.</hi> Now it is at this time when the Lord cometh, that the Kingdoms of this World will become the Kingdoms of God and Chriſt. And it is then God will give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his Servants; at which time the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Worldlings, that are dead in ſin, will be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and then ſhall they be deſtroyed which deſtroyed the Earth; which Earth is their fellow brethren upon the Earth. And alſo by the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before mentioned, it is when the Lord ſhall be revealed, that then to the wicked will be recompenſed Tribulation, and to the Saints Reſt and Conſolation. And when God and Chriſt have taken poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, then ſhall the Saints reign on the Earth, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. <hi>And haſt made us unto God Kings and Prieſts, and we shall reign on the Earth.</hi> And according to this, it is ſaid in
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in 1 Pet. 2.9. Where he mentions thoſe things which are to come, as if they were preſent, which way of ſpeaking is often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>And the like is in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. And in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4.8. It is ſaid, The Crowns are given in that day to all them that love his appearing. For now it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. The Souls are under the Altar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45720:119"/>Now in the next place we are to take notice, who are thoſe that do chiefly fall under this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Puniſhment, mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6,8,9, which in eſpecial manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be thoſe rhat were the Afflictors of the the Servants of God; as in Verſe 6. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to recompence Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them that trouble you.</hi> By which we ſee theſe will be the great ſharers of his Wrath when the Lord comes; as in verſe 8. <hi>In flaming fire, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 9. <hi>VVho shall be punished with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now altho he ſaith this of them that know not God. Now thoſe are ſaid not to know God, that in works deny him, in not obeying the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now this word was more particularly directed to them, that would not have a practical Knowledg of God, and of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as to be obedient thereunto. Now that this Condemnation did not extend to all that had not the knowledg of God; and of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is evident, for in his words there is not all expreſſed; for he did not ſay of all them that knew not God, and all them that knew not the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but to them chiefly that knew it, and would not obey it; for the Lord ſaith, he that knoweth not his Maſters Will, and doeth<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45720:120"/>it not, ſhall be beaten with fewer ſtripes. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo knew that the Jews that neither did know, nor obey the Goſpel, were to be called in at the coming of the Lord, is evident by what is ſaid in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25,26. That when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles be come in, then all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſaved. He ſaith, according as it is written in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
59. read there from the V. 14. to the end of the Chapter; in which is contained Chriſt's coming to Judgment, and the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his People; and it is at that time when he comes to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> That he will turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ungodlineſs from <hi>Jacob.</hi> And then will the reſt of the promiſed Elect be gathered in.</p>
                  <p>Now when the Lord was upon the Earth, he did not in the plain Letter of the Word, either bid us pray for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the Converſion of the Jews, but in the Second and Third Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Prayer that he taught us, they are both included. Where he ſaith, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi> For the Lord knowing that <hi>Iſraels</hi> time to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, would not be until his Second Coming; at which Time ſhould be the Reſtitution of all Things. And then will the Kingdoms of this World become the Kingdoms of our God, and of his Chriſt. And then will <hi>Iſrael</hi> be reſtored, and the promiſed New Covenant made with them; And then will the Will of the Lord be done on Earth as it is done in Heaven (and this the Lord would have us to pray for, before we ask our daily bread); for the Time was not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45720:120"/>determined, but that the days may be ſhortned. And the Lord ſaid to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> Pray for few days unto you.</p>
                  <p>And Chriſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.22. ſaith, For the Elect's ſake, thoſe days ſhall be ſhortned. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt's ſecond coming, in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19,20,21,22,23.
<hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord.</hi> 20. <hi>And he ſhall send</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which before was preached unto you:</hi> 21. <hi>VVhom the Heavens muſt receive, until the times of reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi> 22. <hi>For</hi> Moſes
<hi>truly said to the Fathers, a prophet ſhall the Lord your God raise up unto you, of your brethren, like unto me, him ſhall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he ſhall say unto you.</hi> 23. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that every Soul which will not hear that prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people.</hi> Here the Apoſtle abſolutely tells us, The Lord will again come, and then will the Times of Reſtitution be, the which he ſaith hath been declared by all the Prophets, and by them I here prove the ſame unto you.</p>
                  <p>And in 2 <hi>Esdras</hi> 11.37. <hi>And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out of the wood: And I saw that he sent out a mans voice unto the eagle, and said,</hi> V. 38. <hi>Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the higheſt ſhall say unto thee,</hi> V. 39. <hi>Art not thou it that remaineth of the four beaſts, whom I made to reign in my world, that the end of their<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45720:121"/>times might come through them?</hi> V. 46. <hi>That all the earth may be refreſhed, and may return, being delivered from thy violence, and that ſhe may hope for the judgment and mercy of him that made her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we have all of us been under a very great miſtake, as to our Lord's coming to judgment, taking his coming to judg the World, for that laſt and final Judgment, ſpoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. wherein the Dead, both ſmall and great, ſhall ſtand before the Throne of God: At which time the Sea, and Hell and Death, ſhall deliver up their Dead, which are in them. But when Chriſt comes to Judg the World, there is mention made of no ſuch thing. But whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt shall judg the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom.</hi> Here we muſt not forget whom the Lord calls Dead, it is alſo them that are dead in ſin, and it is thoſe Dead, wirh the living Saints, and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jews, that he will firſt Judg. And whereas it is ſaid in his Kingdom (pray take notice of the word Kingdom) which Kingdom would be but of a ſhort continuance, were it but for a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral day; therefore it is ſaid, that he muſt Reign till he hath put all his Enemies under his feet, which is till the laſt general Judgment, when the Sea, Hell and Death ſhall deliver up their Dead.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what our Lord ſaith concerning his coming,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45720:121"/>him. Then shall he ſit upon the Throne of his glory.</hi> V. 32. <hi>And before him shall be gathered all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and he shall ſeperate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith, he ſhall fit upon the Throne of his Glory; which words argue a continuance of ſome conſiderable time upon his Throne. And the Lord here tells us, who they are that ſhall be gathered. It is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are then upon the Earth at his coming. And the Lord in the 33. V. ſaith, <hi>He shall ſet the Sheep on his right hand, but the Goats on the left.</hi> V. 34, <hi>Then shall the King ſay to them on his right hand, come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the Foundation of the world.</hi> Now whereas the Lord ſaith,
<hi>come ye bleſſed,</hi> that is, they were bleſſed; becauſe they were excepted, and alſo there was that found in them, that did diſtinguiſh them from the wicked of the world. Here, by theſe words of our Lord, we are fully informed that they are to enter into the Kingdom that was prepared for them from the foundation of the World; and we know what Kingdom that was, which was then prepared at the foundation of the World; that it was this material Heaven and Earth, and the Garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> and when Chriſt comes, it is this will be again reſtored to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the reſt of the Elect with them, whom Chriſt will ſet at his right hand, as being part of his Sheep; but this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45720:122"/>them on the right hand and left, is but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Speech, and ſpoken by way of Parable, as I ſhall prove by ſeveral places of Scripture. And whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35. <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me drink, I was a ſtranger and ye took me in.</hi> V. 36. <hi>Naked and ye clothed me, I was ſick and ye viſited me, I was in priſon and ye came unto me.</hi> V. 37. <hi>Then ſhall the Righteous anſwer him, ſaying, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, and fed thee, or thirſty and gave thee Drink?</hi> V. 38. <hi>VVhen ſaw we thee a Stranger and took thee in, or nake and clothed thee?</hi> V. 39. <hi>Or when ſaw we the ſick, or in priſon, and came unto thee?</hi> V. 40. <hi>And the King ſhall anſwer, and ſay unto them, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, in as much as ye have done it, unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> V. 41. <hi>Then ſhall he ſay alſo unto them on the left hand, depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> V. 42. <hi>For I was an hungred and ye gave me no meat, I was a thirſty and ye gave me no drink.</hi> V. 43. <hi>I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in, nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ye clothed me not, ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> V. 44. <hi>Then ſhall they alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred, or a thirſty, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in prison, and did not Miniſter unto thee?</hi> V. 45. <hi>Then ſhall he anſwer them, saying, verily I say unto you, in as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me.</hi> V. 46. <hi>And theſe ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment, but the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45720:122"/>in to Life Eternal.</hi> That is, the Lord then giveth them an aſſurance of their Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So as they are for ever after paſt the power or fear of the Second Death. Now when Chriſt ſaid to them on his Right Hand, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World; he did not then ſay any thing to exclude a Temporal Death: but at the concluſion of the whole matter, the Lord ſaid, The Righteous ſhall go into Life Eternal. That is, then they ſhall have the aſſurance of Eternal Life; for then by the New Covenant-Promiſe, which will then be made with them, they are put paſt the power of the ſecond death; And the Lord by his Word counts a Temporal Death not a dying, as in John 8.51. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if a man keep my Sayings, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi> And when they are again reſtored, then they will be put into a capacity never to offend any more, by the Promiſed New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that then will be made with them; of which the Chriſtian that is now become a New Creature, will be partaker of that promis'd New Covenant with them; but how few is there of ſuch?</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32. that before him ſhall be gathered all Nations; and that he ſhall ſeparate the one from the other; and that he ſhall ſet the Sheep on his Right Hand, and the Goats on his Left. But yet when the bleſſing was by the Lord pronounc'd, the Word <hi>All</hi> was not then included; And if it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45720:123"/>had, all the innocent children, and the poor had been all excluded, becauſe the one had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to do good, upon which the bleſſing was pronounc'd, and the poor had it not to do withal. Nor doth the Lord include the Word <hi>All,</hi> in that Everlaſting Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but this Sentence was chiefly to them that knew him, but would not live in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, nor do the good that was required of them; for they did not deny the knowledge of the Lord; but ſaid, Lord, when ſaw we thee thus and thus? Whereupon the Lord ſaith, In as much as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to me. You have not obeyed the great Commandment I left with you at my departure, which was to love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and that you ſhould bear one another's burdens; and you knowing moſt of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will, wherein my Mercy and Love is comprehended, and in that you have ſhewed no Mercy to the Elect, or Sheep of God, now there remains no Mercy for you, the which I left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record by my Servant
<hi>James,</hi> chap. 2.13. <hi>That he ſhall have judgment without mercy, that have ſhewed no mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if their Puniſhment be ſo great to them, that has done no good in their Generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Capacity; how much ſeverer Puniſhment muſt thoſe Chriſtians expect, that are committing all thoſe Evils, which this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reſt of the Chriſtian World doth abound in, accompanied with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45720:123"/>to the Servants of Chriſt. And as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. <hi>If the Righteous ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Saved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear,</hi> that are filling up their days in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity, ſince every ſin doth augment their Puniſhment. And the Lord alſo tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewen down and caſt into the Fire.</hi> V. 20. <hi>Wherefore by their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> V.
21. <hi>Not every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> V. 22. <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name, and in thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy name done many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works?</hi> V. 23. <hi>Then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you; depart from me ye that work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Here the Lord doth in a more clear man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Figure out to us the Papiſts, with their ſigns and lying wonders, in that they ſay Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy Name done many wonderful works: All which does fully make out, it is thoſe that makes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, but in their Works deny him, which are here in a more particular manner ſhut out. And in the <hi>Revelations</hi> it is ſaid, The Vine is firſt trod in the Wine-preſs of God's wrath. Mat.
25.30. <hi>VVhere the Lord in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the three men to whom the Talents were given; it was he that improved not his Talent, whom the Lord commanded ſhould be caſt into outer<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45720:124"/>darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord alſo ſaith, in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.12,14,15,27.
<hi>A certain Nobleman went into a far Countrey, to receive for himſelf a Kingdom, and to return.</hi> 14. <hi>But his Citizens hated him, and ſent a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger after him, Saying, we will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> 14. <hi>And it came to paſs when he was returned, having received the Kingdom;</hi> The Lord ſaith, Verſe 27. <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies, which would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> Now as to whom this Sentence of Condemnation is paſſed, it doth alſo in a particular manner figure out the Chriſtians to us, in that they have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, and would not have him to reign over them. And the Lord doth not here make mention of the crying ſins of the Times, for the Scriptures do fully make manifeſt, that they ſhall have their part in the <hi>Lake that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond death,</hi> Rev. 21.8. But the Lord, to undeceive them that think they ſhall be happy, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they ſhall be miſerable. Therefore it is ſaid, That it is not him that confeſſeth the Lord with his mouth, and in his works deny him, and that it is not onely the ſhuning the doing evil. (Which ſo few does now adays.) But we muſt alſo learn to do well, for if we Chriſtians are not found ready with grace in our hearts at his coming we ſhall be ſhut out, like the fooliſh Virgins, from thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45720:124"/>nuptials with the Lord, the Bridegroom of Souls. Now whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43.
<hi>All theſe things ſpake Jeſus unto the multitude in parables, and without a parable ſpake he not unto them.</hi> 35. <hi>That it might be fullfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet, Saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things which have been kept ſecret from the foundation of the world.</hi> And in the 36th Verſe, 'tis made mention of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples coming to the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Declare unto us the parable of the Tares of the field.</hi> 37. <hi>He anſwered and ſaid unto them, He that ſoweth the good Seed is the Son of Man.</hi> 38. <hi>The Field is the world, the good Seed are the Children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but the Tares are the Children of the wicked One.</hi> 39. <hi>The Enemy that ſoweth them is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the Harveſt is the end of this world, the Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are the Angels.</hi> 40. <hi>As therefore the Tares are gathered, and burnt in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of this world.</hi> 41. <hi>The Son of Man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity.</hi> 42. <hi>And caſt them into a Furnace of Fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
43, <hi>Then ſhall the Righteous ſhine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here we ſee, this is the Interpretation of the Parable, wherein we are to take notice, that the Tares are the Seed of the Wicked One, and according to the ſaying of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the World that is to be burnt. Pray take notice<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45720:125"/>where this Kingdom is, from whence all things that offend, and do Iniquity, is to be pluckt out; you ſee it is here upon this Earth.</p>
                  <p>Now by this you may more clearly ſee which are the Heavens and Earth which are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the fiery indignation of the Lord's Diſpleaſure. And we ought to take notice of the Words of the Lord, in that he ſaith, he would open his Mouth in Parables, and he would utter things that have been kept ſecret from the Foundation of the World: Which is, That the Glory of the Righteous ſhall be when the Wicked World ſhall be deſtroyed: Whoſe Executioners are ſaid to be the Angels. For although theſe things were hinted to them in Old Time, by the Prophets, yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended them not, no more than that of Chriſt coming to ſuffer; And like us that have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in theſe great matters, as to the Sayings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And whereas the Lord ſaith, The Righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of his Father; he alſo ſaith, in <hi>John</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Now ſeeing that Chriſt and the Father are One, the Kingdom that is the Son's muſt be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's alſo. And it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. <hi>The The Kingdoms of the world are become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our God, and of his Chriſt.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.16. <hi>The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth, the wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands.</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, with all the Nations that forget God.</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:45720:125"/>Verſe 18. <hi>For the needy ſhall not always be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt by theſe words, Wheat, Sheep, and Elect, thereby leaves himſelf ſcope for to take in whom he pleaſes at his coming; the which will be thoſe people which the Prophets have propheſied of, with the poor that are ſaid to be fetch'd in at the coming of the Lord. But by what the Lord ſaith, it is evident, that there will be ſomething found in them to diſtinguiſh them from the Wicked of the World. But as for the Chriſtians that forget God, they muſt look to be turned into Hell, as it is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now it is theſe, and the like places, that have caſt a Veil over our Faces, or Apprehenſions, in taking the Elect, which is to be called in at the coming of the Lord; for the Saints which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him from Heaven, and for the Witneſſes that meet him in the Clouds of Glory, the which then will deſcend from Heaven, and is the place which the Lord ſaid he would prepare for them; and then come again and receive them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>Joh</hi> 14.3. This being the Tabernacle which the Lord ſhall pitch, and not man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4,5. Of which I ſhall ſpeak more in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. But as for thoſe that were before mentioned, The Lord there ſaith, it is all the Nations that ſhall be gathered before him. And it is evident, that the Saints in Henven are not termed the Nations, neither the Damned that are in the infernal Regions. And alſo the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45720:126"/>is to be gathered out of this Kingdom of his. And therefore this Kingdom of his muſt be upon the Earth, in as much as there is no Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in Heaven. And from the Foundation of the World, was Paradice prepared, which does appear to be deſtroyed by the Flood. However, the place where it was, is ſaid to be the Land which the Lord careth for, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12. and which he gave to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8,9. <hi>I will give unto thee and thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion; and I will be their God.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>And God ſaid to</hi> Abraham, <hi>thou ſhalt keep my Commandments, therefore thou and thy Seed after thee in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here God, in the 8th Verſe, gives the Land to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed for an everlaſting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, upon a conditional Covenant, which was in verſe 9. <hi>That God ſaid to</hi> Abraham, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant, therefoee thou and thy Seed after thee, in their generations.</hi> The which they did not do, and therefore received the threatned Curſe, but not the bleſſing. But God's promiſe was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the forementioned Chapter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, That he would eſtabliſh his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him; That is, with himſelf, and his Seed after him, in their Generations, for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant. But it is not to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant, as the former was. The which God hath ſo often rehearſed. that it<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45720:126"/>ſhould be confirmed to them by the mouths of all his Prophets; and as God did promiſe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and to his Seed, the Land, for an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſion, and ſince this Covenant is to be made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed together, then it muſt be at the Reſurrection made good; at which time will be the Reſtitution of all things. Now God ſaith in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.12. That he would ſcatter <hi>Iſrael</hi> into all the Winds; and from one End of the Earth to the other. From theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is the Lord ſaid to gather his Elect at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And God himſelf ſaith, <hi>I will gather</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and others with him. And in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 43.4,5,6,7,8. The Lord ſaith in verſe 4. <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy Life.</hi> Verſe 5. <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee; I will bring thy Seed from the Eaſt, and gather thee from the Weſt.</hi> Verſe
6. <hi>I will ſay to the North, give up; and to the South, keep not back, bring my Sons from far, and my Daughiers from the ends of the Earth.</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>Every one that is called by my Name, for I have created him for my Glory; I have formed him, yea I have made him.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</hi> Now
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> God ſaith, that he created him for his Glory, and theſe are the Elect in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, for whom the Kingdom was prepared from the Foundation of the World: And as in ſome places the Reigns of
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> are intermixt, and Chriſt's firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45720:127"/>coming are intermixt; ſo is here their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with that of their final and laſt Deliverance by Chriſt, when he comes to judge the World. The which, the foregoing Words of the Lord doth make fully out. For when they returned out of the
<hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, they were not gathered from the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North</hi> and <hi>South:</hi> Neither were they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, becauſe they were under another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither did they appear to the Glory of God, when they murdered the Lord of Life; for which they have been a ſcatter'd people ever ſince, throughout the Face of the whole Earth. Now God foreſeeing the ignorance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to the time to come, therefore ſaith, Bring the blind people that have Eyes, and the deaf that have Ears; for they apprehend not the ſayings of the Moſt High, as to the time of their Reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaith, 2 <hi>Eſdras,</hi> in the ſixth chap. verſe 5,6,7,8,9,10. <hi>That ere the preſent years were ſought out, and or ever the inventions of them that now ſin, were turned, before they were ſealed that have gathered Faich for a Treaſure. Then did I conſider theſe things, and they were all made through me alone, and through no other; by me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they ſhall be ended, and by none other.</hi> Verſe 7.
<hi>Then anſwered I, and ſaid, What ſhall be the parting aſunder of the Times, or when ſhall be the firſt, and the beginning of it that followeth?</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, From</hi> Abraham
<hi>unto</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, <hi>when</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Eſau <hi>were born of him,</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45720:127"/>
                     <hi>hand held firſt the heel of</hi> Eſau. Verſe 9. <hi>For</hi> Eſau <hi>is the end of the World. and</hi> Jacob <hi>is the beginning of it that followeth.</hi> Verſe 10.
<hi>The hand of Man is between the heel and the hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here in the <hi>V.</hi> 7. <hi>Eſdras</hi> was deſirous to know what ſhould be the parting aſunder of the times, and when ſhould be the end of the firſt, and the begining of that which followeth; in anſwer to which, God lets him underſtand by the following words, that
<hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> were the figure of both worlds. And God ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, when <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were born,
<hi>Jacobs</hi> hand held firſt the heel of <hi>Eſau.</hi> For
<hi>Eſau</hi> is the end of the world, and <hi>Jacob</hi> is the begining of that which followeth, and the hand of man is now between the heel and the hand. That is, the time of man, now is ſignified to be, between the heel and the hand, by which is meant, labour, ſorrow, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the head is excluded, as not being plac'd between the heel and the hand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they of this world walk in darkneſs, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and miſchief. But the Glory is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the other world, <hi>Jacob.</hi> Where the head is with the Body; In which is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Glory, excellency, and greatneſs. Now whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Jacobs</hi> hand held firſt the heel of <hi>Eſau.</hi> That is, that the Glory of the other world will come in, before this our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful world is gone off. And as I formerly ſhewed you by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> God figured out to us the <hi>Roman Babylon,</hi> ſo God here comprehends
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45720:128"/>this wicked world by <hi>Eſau,</hi> and that which is to come, by <hi>Jacob.</hi> So this place in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2,3,4,5,6. Doth make it fully out, for God ſaith in. <hi>V.</hi> 2. <hi>I have loved you, ſaith the Lord, yet ye ſay, wherein haſt thou loved us? was not</hi> Eſau
<hi>Jacobs brother, ſaith the Lord, yet I loved</hi> Jacob. V. 3. <hi>And I hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and laid his Mountains and his heritage waſt, for the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of the Wilderneſs.</hi> V. 4. <hi>And they ſhall call them the border of Wickedneſs, a people againſt whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</hi> V. 5. <hi>And your eyes ſhall ſee, and ye ſhall ſay, the Lord will be magnified from the borders of Iſrael.</hi> V. 6. <hi>A Son honoureth his father, and a Servant his Maſter, if then I be a father, where is mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and if I be a Maſter, where is my fear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſt unto you, O Prieſts, that deſpiſe my name.</hi> Now what is here ſaid, it is certain it was ſpoken for the time that is to come, in which, God will be magnified in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For at that time, it is evident, the ways of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not pleaſe the Lord, as to the capacity they were then in. And although the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> had the
<hi>Oracles</hi> of God, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet they had not the promiſed new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, made with them, as to be put into a Capacity not to offend; but through ſin, might become as obnoxious to God, as any People. And
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaying, wherein haſt thou loved us? Now God ſaid, was not <hi>Eſau Jacob;</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated
<hi>Eſau.</hi> That is, God had choſen <hi>Jacob</hi> as the figure
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45720:128"/>of the world to come, to whom the moſt high hath promiſed to eſtabliſh an everlaſting covenant with his Seed at that time; and it is this other world in which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the love of God, to
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> here in this world; <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Kingdom before
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and remained ſo after <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as it is ſaid in <hi>Obadiah,</hi> verſe 12. Therefore this <hi>Eſau</hi> here ſpoken of, in <hi>Malachy,</hi> could not be the real <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And alſo, though the people of <hi>Eſau</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, yet God has not curſt the Land, to be an Habitation for evil creatures. For in <hi>Obadiah</hi> 19. it is ſaid, They of the <hi>South</hi> ſhall inherit the Mount of <hi>Eſau</hi> But the Inheritance of this figurative <hi>Eſau</hi> is for ever to lie waſte for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs; according to the ſaying of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and St.
<hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to fullfil the Scriptures. Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. <hi>For I would not, brethren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this Myſtery (leſt ye ſhould be wiſe in your own conceit) that bliwd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in part is happened to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>until the fullneſs of the Gentiles be come in.</hi> Verſe 26.
<hi>And ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved;</hi> as it is written,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20. <hi>There ſhall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob.</hi> Verſe 27. <hi>For this is my covenant unto them, when I ſhall take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waytheir ſins.</hi> Verſe 28.
<hi>As conterning the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they are enemies for your ſake, but as touching the Election, they are beloved for the Fathers ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:45720:129"/>Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that blindneſs in part is happened to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until the fullneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come in. And the Lord himſelf ſaith, in
<hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. <hi>That</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be trodden down of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>until the times of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be fulfilled.</hi> That is, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall not be reſtored, until the Gentile power is quite vanquiſhed, deſtroyed, or extirpated. And that will not be till the Lord cometh, at which time all Gentile power will be deſtroyed, and laid low. And whereas it is ſaid in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 60.10.
<hi>That the Sons of ſtrangers ſhall build thy walls, and their Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee.</hi> That is, thoſe that are Kings at the coming of the Lord, which are and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, ſhall become ſerviceable, and miniſter to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And whereas St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, until the Gentiles be come in. That is, the fullneſs, or the greater Number of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come in, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11.25,26,27,28,29. <hi>So then all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſaved: As it is written there ſhall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and ſhall turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ungodlineſs from Jacob; for this is my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto them, when I ſhall take away their ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee, that the Apoſtle did not ſay, that the Lord was come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> that ſhould turn away ungodlineſs from
<hi>Jacob,</hi> but that he would make this promiſe good to them when he again comes to <hi>Sion.</hi> And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.17. at the latter end, the Lord ſpeaks of putting on Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Vengeance for cloathing, in which he will judge his Enemies; and at the ſame time he<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45720:129"/>will deliver <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith. And in verſe 28. he ſaith, concerning the Goſpel, they are Enemies for your ſakes, but as touching the Election, <hi>they are beloved for their fathers ſakes.</hi> For he there tells us, 29. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without Repentance.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, that they cannot be forgotten of God. Here we ſee St. <hi>Paul</hi> bears his Witneſs, as to God's making good his promiſes to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that we are not taken in, as to diſappoint them of their Inheritance, at the Reſtitution of all things. But that then they ſhall be again taken in, and the Everlaſting Covenant be made with them, according as God has before promiſed to them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
11.30. For although through their unbelief we are taken into mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Number is diminiſhed, yet the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God has by Oath promiſed to make with them, even with both the Houſes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> at that time of Reſtitution, they cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of. For we that are taken in, to be of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in and through Chriſt, we muſt come in, as of the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> of which Race Chriſt came. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the converſion of the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 11.15. ſaith, <hi>What ſhall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Patriarch Levy</hi> in his laſt will and Teſtament, foretold his Sons that they ſhould call him <hi>Heretick</hi> that goeth about to renew the Law by the power of the higheſt; and in the end they ſhould kill him out of hand,<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45720:130"/>as they think, not knowing that he ſhall riſe again, and ſo ſhall ye receive his innocent blood wilfully upon your own heads. For his ſake ſhall your holy place be left deſolate, which you ſhall have defiled by utter forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and your dwelling ſhall not be clean, but you ſhall be curſt among the Heathen, and deſpair ſhall vex you, till he viſit you again. And he further ſaith, then will God raiſe up a new Prieſt, unto whom all the Lords words ſhall be opened: and he ſhall execute true Judgment upon the Earth many days. And his Star ſhall riſe in Heaven, as a King ſhall he ſhew forth the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the open Sunſhine of the day, and he ſhall be magnified over all the world, and be received and ſhine as the Sun upon the Earth, and drive away all darkneſs, and there ſhall be peace upon all the Earth. In his days the Heavens ſhall rejoyce, the Earth ſhall be glad, the clouds ſhall be merry, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord ſhall be poured out upon the Earth as the waters of the <hi>Seas,</hi> and the Angels of Glory that are in the Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſhall rejoyce in him. The Heavens ſhall be opened, and out of the Temple of Glory ſhall ſanctification come upon him with the fathers voice, as from <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the Glory of the higheſt, ſhall be ſpread out upon him, and the Spirit of underſtanding and ſanctification ſhall reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, whereof he ſhall give abundantly<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45720:130"/>and mightily to his children in truth for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; and there ſhall none ſucceed him from Generation to Generation, World without end. In his Prieſthood all ſin ſhall come to an end, (and the Unrighteous ſhall ceaſe from their Naughtineſs); but the Righteous ſhall reſt in Him, and He ſhall open the Gates of Paradice, and ſtay the Threatning Sword againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and feed the Lambs with the Fruit of Life, and the Spirit of Holineſs ſhall be in them. He ſhall bind up <hi>Belial,</hi> and give his own children power to tread down Hurtful Spirits, and the Lord ſhall rejoice in his children, and accept them as his Beloved for evermore. Then ſhall <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> be glad; and then ſhall I and all Saints rejoyce. Now my children, ye have heard all; therefore chuſe unto you either Light or Darkneſs, either the Law of the Lord, or the Works of
<hi>Belial;</hi> and we anſwered our Father, ſaying, We will walk before the Lord, according to his Law. And my Father ſaid, The Lord is Witneſs, and his Angels are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I am Witneſs, and your ſelves are Witneſſes of the Words of my mouth: And when we anſwered, We will be Witneſſes, <hi>Levy</hi> reſted with this charge be given unto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaking of the time when the Kingdoms of this World ſhould become the Kingdoms of God and Chriſt: And of the reign of the raiſed Saints, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9. he ſaith, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held till the thrones were caſt down, and the antient<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45720:131"/>of days did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, and the hair of his Head like the pure wooll, his Throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</hi> V. 10. <hi>A fiery ſtream iſſued, and came forth from before him, thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him, the Judgment was ſet, and the Books were opened.</hi> V. 11. <hi>I beheld then, becauſe of the voice of the great words which the horn ſpake, I beheld even till the beaſt was ſlain and his body deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye ſee here alſo that <hi>Daniel</hi> makes mention of the Deſtruction of the Beaſt; and whereas he ſaith, he beheld till the Beaſt was ſlain, which may only ſignify that he received the Sentence of Condemnation, and his body deſtroyed, his greatneſs and his grandeur of his Power brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. After which he is given to the burning flame, Soul and Body: And as St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, after Chriſt came, <hi>The beaſt was taken alive, and caſt into a lake of ſire burning with brimſtone.</hi> And
<hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, V. 12. <hi>As concerning the reſt of the beaſt, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and a time.</hi> V. 13. <hi>I ſaw in the night Viſions, and behold one like the Sun of man came with the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and came to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</hi> V. 14. <hi>And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all People, Nations, and Languages ſhould ſerve him, his dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45720:131"/>ſhall not paſs away, and his Kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi> And whereas the Prophet ſaith there was given to Chriſt Dominion, Glory and a Kingdom, which was, that all People, Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve and obey him. And in v. 18. it is ſaid, The Saints of the moſt High ſhall take the Kingdom, and poſſeſs the Kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. Here it is ſaid, That the Saints of the moſt High ſhall take the Kingdom, that is, be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with the Kingdom, or made partakers of the Kingdom, of which Chriſt is head. And he tells us in the 27. v. <hi>That the Kingdom, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe Kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee by theſe words, that it is fully clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where this Kingdom is ſaid to be, which will be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt High. That it is the greatneſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under the whole Heaven. Therefore it muſt be upon the Earth, at the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things. For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, c. 24. v. 4.
<hi>The Earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languiſheth and fadeth away, the haughty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Earth do languiſh.</hi> In theſe laſt words the Prophet tells us his meaning, in ſaying the Earth Mourneth, and the World Languiſheth; For he ſaith it is the Haughty People of the Earth do Languiſh. V. 5. <hi>The Earth alſo is<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45720:132"/>defiled under the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, changed the Ordinances, broken the everlaſting Covenant.</hi> Whereby we ſee that the Earth is defiled, through the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of man that is upon it. Now Chriſt dyed to reſtore loſt man, that he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to himſelf a Glorious Church withour ſpot, or wrinkle. And he will reſtore the Earth to be, for what it was intended in the firſt Creation, which was for the bringing up of a Holy Seed, and to be <hi>Iſraels</hi> inheritance, and the Earth was prepared for their Nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, which as the Earth did fill. God might tranſlate them to thoſe Heavenly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</p>
                  <p>Now in the day of the Reſtitution of all things, Chriſt has more than a ruling Power in the Hearts of his People, or with his Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But then will be given to him all the Kingdoms of the Earth, to ſerve and obey him: Then ſhall it be term'd but one Kingdom, as having but one Head to be the chief Ruling Power; and the raiſed Saints to Rule under him. And <hi>Daniel</hi> doth further aſſure us by the interpretation of
<hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Dream, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. <hi>That in the days of thoſe Kings ſhall the God of Heaven ſet up a Kingdom, which never ſhall be deſtroyed, and the Kingdom ſhall not be left to other People, but it ſhall break in pieces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all theſe Kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> V. 45. <hi>For as much as thou ſaweſt that the ſtone was cut out of the Mountain without hands, and that<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45720:132"/>it brake in pieces the Iron, the Braſs, the Clay, the Silver, and the Gold, the great God hath made known to the King what ſhall come to paſs hereafter, and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof is ſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Prophet here tells us, that the Dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof is ſure, that is, we may bind upon it, that the God of Heaven will ſet up a Kingdom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>which never will be deſtryed. And that the Kingdom ſhall not be left to other People, but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all other Kingdoms, and ſtand for ever. For although it is ſaid, Chriſt and his Raiſed Saints ſhall reign a Thouſand Years; the which, as I before ſaid, thoſe words doth not at all ſignifie that the Reign of Chriſt, and his raiſed Saints ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue no longer than the thouſand years; but that the Glory may not ſo eminently, or viſibly appear, after <hi>Satan</hi> is looſed to accompliſh his wickedneſs in his deceiving his <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog;</hi> after which he ſhall receive his final Doom.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19,20,21.
<hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: awake, and ſing ye that dwell in duſt; for thy dew is as the dew of Herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead. Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee; hide thy ſelf, as it were, for a little moment, until the indignation be over-paſt.</hi> 21. <hi>For behold the Lord cometh out of his place, to puniſh the Inhabitants of the earth for their<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45720:133"/>iniquity: The earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it is as well thoſe that are Spiritually Dead in Sin: wherein by the Lord's ſaying Men, is comprehended the whole Man, both Soul and Body: The Soul being already Dead, and the Body daily dying. Now when theſe dead Men ſhall Live, he farther tells us, it ſhall be when his dead body ſhall ariſe, which is in the firſt Reſurrection, as I have proved by Scripture. And as to the Body of the Saints, you ſee they are not termed Men, becauſe the better part of them is alive, and united to the Lord of Glory. Upon which the Lord terms the dead Bodies of the Saints to be his dead Body: And that this riſing is at the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, is further cleared, in that he then tells us, the Earth ſhall caſt out the Dead. In the following verſe, the Lord inſtructeth his People, that then ſhall be on the Earth, to hide them for a little moment, until the indignation be over paſt; that is, not to appear much in the World, either in pompous ſplendor, Action, or Labour; But in a more particular manner to ſecure themſelves in himſelf, and that the more we ſee the day approaching. At that time when the Lord cometh to Puniſh the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth; he alſo then will puniſh the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and ſlay the <hi>Dragon</hi> that is in the Sea. By this we ſee that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives us the ſame account, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> does, as<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45720:133"/>concerning the deſtruction of the beaſt, and the binding of Satan. And God ſpeaking to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of the Reſtoration of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the Reſurrection, ſaith in the 37 c. where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the Valley of dead bones, which were very many, and very dry, and they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him how they came together, all in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative way; after which the Lord opens to him the meaning thereof, as in v. 11. <hi>God ſaid unto him, Son of Man, theſe bones are the whole Houſe of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>Behold they ſay our bones are dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts.</hi> V.
12. <hi>Therefore Propheſy and ſay to them, thus ſaith the Lord God, behold, O my people, I will open your Graves, and cauſe you to come up out of your Graves, and bring you into the land of</hi> Iſrael. V. 13. <hi>And ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your Graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves.</hi> V. 14. <hi>And ſhall put my Spirit in you, and ye ſhall live, and I ſhall place you in your own Land; then ſhall ye know that I the Lord have ſpoken it, and performed it, ſaith the Lord.</hi> V. 15. <hi>The word of the Lord came again unto me, ſaying.</hi> V. 16. <hi>Moreover thou Son of Man, take thee one ſtick and write upon it for</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>and for the Children of</hi> Iſrael
<hi>his companions; then take another ſtick and write upon it for</hi> Joſeph <hi>the ſtick of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and for all the houſe of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>his companions.</hi> V. 17. <hi>And joyn them one to another into one ſtick, and they ſhall become one in thine hand.</hi> V. 21. <hi>Say unto them, thus ſaith<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45720:134"/>the Lord God, behold</hi> I
<hi>will take the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from among the Heathen, where they be gone, and I will gather them on every ſide, and bring them into their own Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here you ſee again by this, what was the meaning of the dry bones, the which the Lord declared to him, was the whole Houſe of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> that is, the whole of them that are to be ſaved; for St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, they are not all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that are of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> But this Promiſe was made to them that then ſaid, we are caſt off, that they were a part of the whole Body which ſhould ariſe out of their Graves, and be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Reſurrection, and be united to their Head and Husband, at which time the two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be gathered together from among the Heathen, and be made one People for ever. And <hi>Iſa.</hi> ſaith in the 66. c. 8. v. <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing, who hath ſeen ſuch a thing, ſhall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day, or ſhall a Nation be born at once? for as ſoon as</hi> Sion <hi>Travelled, ſhe brought forth her Children.</hi> V. 9.
<hi>Shall</hi> I <hi>bring to the birth, and not cauſe to bring forth, ſaith the Lord? ſhall</hi> I <hi>cauſe to bring forth, and ſhut up the Womb, ſaith thy God?</hi> v. 10. <hi>Rejoyce ye with</hi> Jeruſalem,

                        </gap> of her Glory.</hi> v. 12. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord behold,</hi> I <hi>will extend peace to her like a River, and <pb n="73" facs="tcp:45720:134"/>the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing ſtream, then ſhall ye ſuck; ye ſhall be born upon her ſides, and be dandled upon her knees.</hi> v. 13. <hi>As one whom his Mother comforteth, ſo will</hi> I <hi>comfort you, and ye ſhall be comforted in</hi> Jeruſalem. v. 14. <hi>And when you ſee this your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your bones ſhall flouriſh like an herb, and the hand of the Lord ſhall be known towards his Servants, and his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation towards his enemies.</hi> v. 15.
<hi>For behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebukes with flames of Fire.</hi> v. 16. <hi>For by fire and ſword will the Lord plead with all Fleſh, and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many,.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee that a Nation ſhall be born at once, and at that time <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall rejoyce in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they are again re-eſtabliſhed, they nor their Seed, ſhall never more be caſt off: But be the inheritors of Eternal Life. Now that ſome will enter into this Kingdom, but not by this Everlaſting Covenant is evident by what God ſaith, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.24. <hi>In that day ſhall</hi> Iſrael <hi>be the third with</hi> Egypt, <hi>and with</hi> Aſſiria, <hi>even a bleſſing in the midſt of the Land.</hi> V. 25.
<hi>Whom the Lord of Hoſts ſhall bleſs, ſaying, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be</hi> Egypt <hi>my people, and</hi> Syria <hi>the work of my hands, and</hi> Iſrael
<hi>mine inheritance.</hi> And in Ezek. 16.59. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will even deal with thee as thou haſt done, which haſt deſpiſed the Oath in breaking the Covenant.</hi> V. 60. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I will remember my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45720:135"/>with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will eſtabliſh unto thee an Everlaſting Covenant.</hi> V. 61. <hi>Then thou ſhalt remember thy ways, and be aſhamed when thou ſhalt receive thy Siſters, thine elder and thy younger, and I will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee for daughters, but not by thy Covenant.</hi> V. 62. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord.</hi> And to prove that this was not ſpoken of the <hi>Jews</hi> when they firſt received the Goſpel, is evident, for in the V. 19. Of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Chap.</hi> the Lord ſaith, <hi>In that day ſhall there be an Altar to the Lord in the midſt of the Land of</hi> Egypt: <hi>And in</hi> V. 21. <hi>It is ſaid, The Lord ſhall be known in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>ſhall know the Lord in that day, and ſhall do ſacrifice and obligations, yea they ſhall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it.</hi> V. 22. <hi>And the Lord ſhall ſmite</hi> Egypt, <hi>he ſhall ſmite and heal it, and they ſhall return to the Lord, and he ſhall be intreated of them, and ſhall heal them.</hi> Here we ſee at this time when they are again call'd in, they are to do ſacrifices, the which was all aboliſhed when Chriſt firſt came; but at Chriſts ſecond coming, we are to have ſome new inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore the Lord bids us hold faſt till he comes,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25. But as to what the ſacrifices will be when the Lord comes, we know not, but that there will be ſacrifices, I ſhall hereafter prove; there was ſacrifices before the Law, as from <hi>Abels</hi> time to
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:45720:135"/>and ſo forward. In the next place, it is ſaid that <hi>Egypt ſhall return unto the Lord.</hi> Now, had they not been turned before, it could not have been ſaid, they ſhould have returned, but turned to the Lord. And when they are returned again, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is then to be the Lords inheritance, and to be a bleſſing in the midſt of the Land, the which are now a people caſt off of the Lord, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered throughout the face of the whole Earth. As to what God ſaith by
<hi>Ezek.</hi> concerning the two Siſters, doth ſeem to be ſpoken by
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> under the names of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and
<hi>Samaria:</hi> In that <hi>Sodom</hi> was term'd the Elder, and
<hi>Samaria</hi> the younger. For <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Kingdom before
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> but I ſay not this by proof, but ſuppoſition; And in. V. 61. It is ſaid they are given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but not the ſame Covenant God made with <hi>Iſrael.</hi> By which we may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here the Lord doth not ſay that Iſrael did not know God; but that they did not know the Lord their redeemer.</hi> But when this Covenant is eſtabliſht, then ſhall they knew that he is the Lord. V. 3. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45720:136"/>never open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame, when</hi> I <hi>am pacified,</hi> towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord God.</p>
                  <p>

<hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> is called in, the Lord calls them his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and therefore they will never more be caſt off. And alſo it is evident they will be call'd in when the Lord comes to Judge the world, as it is ſaid in
<hi>Joel</hi> 3.9,10,11. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare War, wake up ye mighty Men, let all the Men of War draw near, let them come up.</hi> V. 10. <hi>Beat your Plow-ſhares into Swords, and your Pruning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks into Spears, let the weak ſay,</hi> I <hi>am ſtrong.</hi> V. 11.
<hi>Aſſemble your ſelves, and come all ye Heathen, and gather your ſelves together round about: Thither cauſe thy mighty ones to come down O Lord.</hi> Theſe mighty ones being the Angels, which are ſpoken of by the Lord, in the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> And it is ſaid in the 12th verſe, <hi>Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the Valley of</hi> Jehoſhaphat, <hi>for there will</hi> I <hi>ſet to Judg the heathen round about.</hi> V. 13. <hi>Put ye in the Sickle, for the harveſt is ripe,<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45720:136"/>come get ye down for the preſs is full; the fats over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, for the wickedneſs is great.</hi> V. 14. <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, multitudes in the valley of deciſion; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of deciſion.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>The Sun and the Moon ſhall be darkned, and the Stars ſhall withdraw their ſhining.</hi> V. 16. <hi>The Lord ſhall roar out of</hi> Sion, <hi>and utter his voice from</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and the heavens and earth ſhall ſhake, but the Lord will be the hoſt of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the ſtrength of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.

                  </p>
                  <p>Here you ſee that at, and after the Day of Judgment, the Lord will have his dwelling in <hi>Sion,</hi> his Holy Mountain; at whith time
'tis ſaid <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall know the Lord is their God: And then ſtrangers ſhall no more paſs through her. And it is ſaid in that time, in <hi>Joel</hi> 3.18. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the Mountains ſhall drop down new Wine, and the hills ſhall flow with Milk, and all the Rivers of</hi> Juda <hi>ſhall flow with Waters, and a Fountain ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the Valley of</hi> Sittim. In this verſe is contained the wonderful plenty that will be at that time, and in thoſe days, accompanied with the pouring forth of the Spirit, ſignified to us by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is ſaid to come out of the Houſe of the Lord, and water the Valley of <hi>Sittim.</hi> And whereas it is ſaid in v. 19.

<hi>Egypt,</hi> but the Figurative, which is ſpoken of by St. <hi>John,</hi> where the Witneſſes are ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. Their Dead Bodies ſhall lie in the Street of the great City which Spiritually is called
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where alſo our Lord was Crucified. This is the <hi>Egypt</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> here ſpeaks of, ſhall be made a deſolation, but the real <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall be inhabited, as I before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. But we may ſay, why is it Spiritually called
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the place where our Lord was Crucified? it is firſt termed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> by reaſon that all the abominations of
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> is there committed, and in that it is termed <hi>Egypt,</hi> is becauſe <hi>Egypt</hi> was the place where the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſo cruelly oppreſſed, and in that it is termed the place where the Lord was Crucified, is not only becauſe he was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Power, but their daily Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of him, in that they ſay it is the real Body and Blood of our Lord, that they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtribute amongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So this <hi>Edom</hi> is not the real Land of <hi>Eſau,</hi> but the figurative one; for as I before ſhewed you, that the real Land of
<hi>Eſau</hi> is to be inhabited by them of the <hi>South;</hi> but theſe figurative ones made a deſolation. And why it is ſaid for their violence againſt the Children of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:45720:137"/>Now it was the real <hi>Egypt,</hi> an
<hi>Idumea,</hi> which did moſt afflict the Natural Seed of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Now it is evident, that the true Chriſtians that are taken in to be of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> muſt come in through Criſt, who is of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> And it is theſe of <hi>Judah</hi> alſo that this
<hi>Egypt, Idumea,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> have been the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictors and Murderers of; And the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſaith in <hi>Joel</hi> 3.10,21. But <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall dwell for ever, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from Generation to Generation. V. 21. For I will cleanſe their blood that I have not cleanſed, for the Lord dwelleth in <hi>Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be rebuilt, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue from Generation to Generation, by which we ſee in this glorious time, there will be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and giving in Marriage by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Generations here ſpoken of. And then the Lord, at that time when he comes again, will cleanſe their Blood, which he hath not cleanſed, at which time the Lord will dwell in <hi>Sion,</hi> which <hi>Sion</hi> may be comprehended under at wofold meaning, as the glorious Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle where he will dwell, from which he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the real <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> And at that time will the Lord make the place of the Soles of his Feet glorious, as it is ſaid
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.13. And then it is that the Promiſe will be made good to
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> That in thee, and thy Seed, all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Earth ſhall be called bleſſed. Now they are not ſo, but at that time it will be ſo. Now whereas the Lord in the ſame chap. of <hi>Joel,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:45720:138"/>ſpeaketh of the Enemies of the Children of
<hi>Judah,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they ſold them to the Grecians, that they might remove them far from their Borders. The Lord ſaith of the Enemies of <hi>Judah,</hi> in V. 8. I will ſell your Sons and your Daughters into the Hands of the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> and they ſhall ſell them to the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> to a people far off, for the Lord hath ſpoken it. Now the <hi>Sabeans</hi> are of <hi>Sheba,</hi> the which People is foretold of by the Prophet from the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.6. That they ſhould find Mercy at that time, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is again reſtored. Now theſe that have been the Oppreſſors of <hi>Judah,</hi> although they themſelves that are left unconverted, till the coming of the Lord, are to be deſtroyed; yet their Children, we here ſee are not to be cut off with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but are ſaid that then they ſhould be ſold to be Servants, to a People whom the Lord will then receive into Mercy. Now theſe are to be ſervants to them that are ſervants to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for God ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.12. <hi>The Nation and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh; yea, thoſe Nations ſhall be utterly waſted.</hi> And the Lord ſaith in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.7. I <hi>ſaid, ſurely thou wilt fear me: Thou wilt receive inſtruction; ſo their dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould be cut off, howſoever</hi> I <hi>puniſhed them, but they roſe early, and corrupted all their doings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee God had not forſaken <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they had not firſt forſaken him, and therefore now they muſt wait until it is his time to be gracious unto them; as in v. 8. of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45720:138"/>Chapter, <hi>Therefore wait ye upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the day that I riſe up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the Nations, that I may aſſemble the Kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce Anger, for all the Earth ſhall be devoured with the Fire of my jealouſie.</hi> 9. <hi>For then will I turn to the People a pure language, that they may all call upon the Name of the Lord, to ſerve him with one conſent.</hi> 10. <hi>From the Rivers of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>my Supplicants, even the Daughters of my diſperſed ſhall bring mine Offering.</hi> 11. <hi>In that day ſhalt thou not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all thy doings, wherein thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt me; for then will I take away out of the midſt of thee them that rejoyce in thy pride, and thou ſhalt be no more haughty. And I will alſo leave in the midſt of thee an afflicted and poor People, and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord. The rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall not do iniquity, nor ſpeak lies, neither ſhall a deceitful tongue be found in their Mouth, for they ſhall feed and lie down, and none ſhall make them afraid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord telleth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he will take out from the midſt of them, them that rejoyce in their Pride; that is, he would take their enemies out of their Land, and their City, which was the Glory of all Lands; and therefore termed <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Pride. And the Lord ſaith, I will leave in the midſt of them an Afflicted poor People, which ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord, and be partakers of the immediate Bleſſedneſs and Glory, as the following words make appear,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45720:139"/>
                     <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.14,15, &amp;c. <hi>Sing, O Daughter of</hi> Sion, <hi>ſhout O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>be glad and rejoice with all the Heart, O Daughter of</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>The Lord hath taken away thy Judgments, he hath caſt out thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the King of</hi> Iſrael,
<hi>even the Lord is in the midſt of thee, thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more. In that day it ſhall be ſaid to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>fear thou not, and to</hi> Sion, <hi>let not thy hands be ſlack. The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee is mighty, he will ſave, he will rejoyce over thee with Joy, he will reſt in his Love, he will joy over thee with ſinging. I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them that are ſorrowful for the ſolemn aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. Behold, at that time I will undo all that Afflict thee, and I will ſave her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praiſe and fame in every Land, where they have been put to ſhame. At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you, for I will make you a name and a Praiſe among all the People of the Earth, when I turn back your capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity before your Eyes, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee, that at the Time that the Lord will deliver
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> his Determination is to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nations, and aſſemble the Kingdoms, that he may pour upon them his fierce Anger.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what the Lord ſaith to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> concerning the building of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, which is from the beginning of the 4th chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where the Lord ſheweth him how the Temple ſhould again be<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45720:139"/>built the ſecond time; and how every thing ſhould be ordered, according to what it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; vvhich is all along treated of from the 40th chapter to the 47th chapter, except the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 43d chapter to the 10th verſe; and there he ſpeaks of the Glory of the Lord, and what the Lord ſaid to him concerning his Dwelling in the midſt of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7,8. <hi>And he ſaid unto me, Son of man, the place of my Throne, and the place of the Soles of my Feet, where I dwell in the midſt of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>for ever, and my Holy Name, ſhall the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>no more defile, neither they nor their Kings, by their Whoredom, nor by the Carcaſes of their Kings in their high places.</hi> 8. v. <hi>In their ſetting their threſhold by my threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olds, and their poſts by my poſts, and the Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and them; they have even defiled my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name by their abominations that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: wherefore I have conſumed them in mine Anger.</hi> 9. v. <hi>Now let them put away their Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Carcaſſes of their Kings far from me, and I will dwell in the midſt of them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee, the Lord's promiſing the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> to dwell with them for ever, after the Temple was built the ſecond time, was but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n conditions; and the conditions was the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away their ſins; which if they did, God would dwell with them for ever. That is, the Ever of this World, as well as that which is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:45720:140"/>This is to ſhew, That there was no decree in God, for theirs, or the Temples Deſtruction; but that his Promiſe was but at that time condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional with them, as it was formerly with
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his ſeed; as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9. And alſo
<hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.25. <hi>Therefore now, Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>keep with thy Servant</hi> David, <hi>my Father, that thou haſt promiſed him, ſaying, there ſhall not fail thee a man in my ſight to ſit on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>So we ſee in the Ever of this World, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were all along conditional. And the ever of this World, is till the time of the Reſtitution of all things. Now <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at their Return from the
<hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, had a freſh promiſe of God, of his dwelling amongſt them in the Ever of this World, if they would put away their ſins. Now the foreknowledge in God of their miſcarriage, ſignifies nothing, as to a Decree in God. And when they will not obey, then it is the Lord ſaith, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9. Now the Lord therefore, in the 47th Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 1. v. ſpeaks nothing of the deſtruction of the Temple that was then to be built, becauſe it was not for their ſins, that built it, that did occaſion the deſtroying of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no mention made of the Temple being to be rebuilt the third time. Whereupon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet only ſaid (of which we are to take notice in
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1. <hi>Afterward he brought me again t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now in that he ſaith, afterwards he brought meagain, it is to ſignifie to us, that it vvas not at one and the ſame time. That is, That the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters iſſued not out from under the Threſhold, at the building of the ſecond Temple. But that this vvas ſpoken for time to come, becauſe alſo of the Trees there mentioned, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.7,12. <hi>By the Rivir, upon the Bank thereof, on this ſide and on that ſide, ſhall grow all Trees for meat, whoſe Leaf ſhall not fade, neither ſhall the fruit thereof be conſumed; it ſhall bring forth new fruits, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his months, becauſe their Waters iſſued out of the Sanctuary, and the fruit thereof ſhall be for meat, and the leaf thereof ſhall be for medicine.</hi> And at that time theſe Trees do grovv, all <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> is then gathered; as in the 13. v. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, this ſhall be the border, whereby ye ſhall inherit the Land, according to the Twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael: Joſeph <hi>ſhall have two portions.</hi> At vvhich time alſo, vvhen all <hi>Iſrael</hi> is gathered, the ſtranger that ſojourneth, ſhall have a portion vvith them; as in the 22. v. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that ye ſhall divide the Land by Lot for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here vve ſee, that vvhen this River is to be, then all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> vvill be gathered, and that then the Sojourner is to have an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance vvith them. And then ſhall the true Chriſtian have a portion in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> vvhen the Lord again comes. And then vvill be the Reſtitution of All Things. Novv all along the time of this World, whilſt there was a Temple, the Prieſts and Levites had no Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Land given them, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.27. <hi>And in the day that he goeth into the Sanctuary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inner Court to Miniſter in the Sanctuary, he ſhall Offer his Sin-Offerings, ſaith the Lord God. And it ſhall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their Inheritance, and ye ſhall give them no poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I am their poſſeſſion.</hi> 29. <hi>They ſhall eat the Meat-Offering, and the Sin-Offering, and the Treſpaſs-Offering, and every Dedicated thing is</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee that the Prieſts then had no Land given them; but when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> is again gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the Tribe of
<hi>Levy</hi> is to have a portion of Land given them, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
48.9. So on to the 14 v. and altho there is none of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> now ſaid to follow the Lamb Chriſt; ſo as to be ſealed for the Glorious Tabernacle, yet then when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is gathered, then are they not excluded, but he will have his Portion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of them, as in
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.1. <hi>From<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45720:141"/>the North End, to the Coaſt of the way of Heth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazorenan, the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Damaſcus, Nothward, to the Coaſt of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math, (for theſe are his, beſide Eaſt and Weſt) a Portion for Dan.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> did foreſee that Satan would more prevail with the Seed of <hi>Dan,</hi> than the reſt of them, by what he ſaid of him at his Death, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.17. <hi>Dan ſhall be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by the way, an Adder in the Path, that biteth the Horſes heels, ſo that his Rider ſhall fall backward.</hi> Which ſignifies, they ſhould wholly fall off. And by what <hi>Dan</hi> ſaith of his Children in his laſt Teſtament, is to the ſame effect: For he ſaith, I am ſure in the latter days ye ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Lord, and walk in naughtineſs, working the abominations of the Gentiles, and haunting wicked Women in all lewdneſs, by the Working of deceitful Spirits in you; For I have read in <hi>Enoch,</hi> that Satan is your Prince, and that all the Spirits of Fornication and Pride ſhall ply themſelves in laying Snares for the Children of <hi>Dan,</hi> to make them ſin before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Here we may ſee what was the reaſon that none of
<hi>Dan</hi> was of that Number, which was to be Sealed for the Glorious Tabernacle when the Lord again comes, which is the <hi>Sion</hi> that ſhall be revealed; and then ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be built, having twelve Gates (as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. from the 31. v. to the 35.) called after the Names of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to that of the New
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which comes down<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45720:142"/>from Heaven; of which it is ſaid, There is no Temple in it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein; for the Lord God almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it.</hi> But as to the New Earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there is ſaid, will be a Temple, for from under the threſhold of which, ſhall iſſue forth the Waters ſpoken of, <hi>Ezek</hi> 47.1. Now that theſe Waters here ſpoken of, are real Waters, is certain, in that there is nothing in the whole Book of God, to prove it a figurative ſpeech; and we are not to makefigures; and that there ſhall be, by theſe Waters, real Fruit Trees, as is ſaid; and alſo abundance of Fiſh in the River: For the Lord hath declared that then the Earth ſhall abound with all good things. And then of
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſhall be ſaid from that day, the Lord is there, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.35. <hi>It was round about eighteen thouſand mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and the name of the City from that day ſhall be, The Lord is there.</hi> And then it is, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle will be fullfilled in the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the kindneſs of the Lord to them in the Ages to come, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6,7. <hi>And hath raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus. That in the ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his kindneſs towards us, through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in Heaven we neither read of Ages nor Generations; and were the Ages here ſpoken of meant of them that are in Heaven, he would have ſaid, That the Ages that are paſt might<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45720:142"/>ſee the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his kindneſs towards them; becauſe that they being in Heaven, would ſooner behold the exceeding Kindneſs of the Lord toward them, than thoſe that are afterward to go to Heaven of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Generations or Ages. Therefore the kindneſs here ſpoken of muſt be manifeſted here, when the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall deſcend out of Heaven, when that Glorious Tabernacle ſhall be Revealed, which the Lord ſhall pitch, and not Man, over the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And the Land that is given by the Lord, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.14. appears to be far larger, than what <hi>Iſrael</hi> has had in Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what <hi>Obadiah</hi> ſaith in the firſt part of the Chapter, where he treats of the Real Seed of <hi>Eſau;</hi> and from the
15. v. downward, of the Day of the Lord, being near upon all the Heathen, by which he comprehends the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the World, that their reward ſhould then be given them. At which time, there ſhould be deliverance on Mount
<hi>Sion,</hi> as it is ſaid in the 17. v. <hi>But upon Mount Sion ſhall be deliverance, and there ſhall be Holineſs, and the Houſe of Jacob ſhall poſſeſs their poſſeſſions.</hi> 20. <hi>And the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Hoſt of the Children of Iſrael, ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that of the Canaanites, even to Zarephath, and the Captivity of Jeruſalem, which is in Sepharad, ſhall poſſeſs the Cities of the South.</hi> 21. <hi>And Saviours ſhall come upon Mount Sion to Judg the Mount of Eſau, and the Kingdoms ſhall be the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:45720:143"/>Here you ſee this Prophet, with
<hi>Eſdras,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the Wicked World, under the Name of
<hi>Eſau.</hi> And this Prophet alſo gives us to underſtand, when the Kingdom ſhall be the Lords; That is, when Saviours come upon Mount
<hi>Sion,</hi> and the World is Judged. By which words we ſee, that now the Kingdom is not termed the Lords, not till ſuch time, that he comes to Judg the World, and to reſtore <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>'s Inheritance to them: And then at that time the Kingdom will be the Lords. St. <hi>Paul</hi> Terms this World, as it is now, to be ruled by the Devil: Whereas he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4.4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.</hi> And in Eph. 6.12. he ſaith, <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities againſt Powers, and againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, and againſt Spiritual Wickedneſs in high places.</hi> And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil boaſting to our Saviour of his Power,
<hi>Luke</hi> 4.6. <hi>When he ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of this World in a moment of time, and the Devil ſaid unto him, all this Power will I give thee, and the Glory of them, for that is delivered unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, after mankind again became wilfully wicked, God left them to Satan's Deluſion; And although the Devil is the Father of Lies, yet he would ſcarce have told them to the God of Truth, who knew how far his Power did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. And the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 14.30.
<hi>Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the Prince of this World cometh, and hath no part in me.</hi> But you may ſay, I thought God had ruled
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45720:143"/>all things in Heaven and Earth. God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly over-rule the Devil, or elſe he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Righteous from off the Earth, were not his Power limited by the moſt high, but the viſible rule, as is declared by the Apoſtle, is in the Devil, who carries on the Darkneſs of this World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. by himſelf, and all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents; for it is ſaid, <hi>That he ruleth in the Hearts of the Children of the Diſobedient;</hi> but you may ſay, the Lord did ſay to his Diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.1. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, that there be ſome of them that ſtand here, which ſhall not taſt of Death, till they have ſeen the Kingdom of God come with Power.</hi> Which was made out in his Transfiguration, in 2. v. <hi>Six days after, Jeſus taketh</hi> Peter, James <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and leadeth them up into an high Mountain, apart by themſelves, and he was transfigured before them.</hi> 3. v. <hi>And his Raiment became ſhining exceeding white as Snow, ſo as no Fuller on Earth can white them.</hi> 4. v. <hi>And there appeared unto them</hi> Elias,
<hi>with</hi> Moſes, <hi>and they were talking with Jeſus.</hi> 7. v.
<hi>And there was a Cloud overſhadowed them, and a voice came out of the Cloud, ſaying, this is my beloved Son hear him.</hi> (Now the other Evangeliſts ſay, a bright Cloud.) Which makes it out to us, where the Heavenly Powers are, there is the Kingdom of God; which Viſion was a Figure of the Glory which ſhall be Revealed. For there Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his Glory, accompanied with his Saints from Heaven, and with his Living Saints on Earth, and the Voice of God thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45720:144"/>us, that we might not miſtake, and take mean and low things for the glorious Kingdom of God and Chriſt; of which our Lord is not yet in poſſeſſion of. It was then within two days before he that is now in Poſſeſſion, was to be turn'd out, for a Thouſand years is but as one day, and one day as a Thouſand years with the Lord; nor to us, a Thouſand years will appear but as one day, compared with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37. <hi>And at the appointed time, he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> But as to what the Lord ſaid, after he aroſe, in <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18.
<hi>Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſaying, all Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> That was, He then had compleated the Purchaſe thereof, and had the full aſſurance of it from the Father, altho he was not in the real poſſeſſion of it: But it is our way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and much more the Scripture way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that when any thing is given us, and ſo confirm'd on us, that we cannot be diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, then we ſay, ſuch an Eſtate is given us; altho the other that injoys it, is not at preſent put out of Poſſeſſion. The which the Apoſtle in
<hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. doth make it more plainly appear, wherein he ſaith in the
8. v. <hi>God hath put all things in ſubjection under his Feet, for in that he put all things in ſubjection under him, he left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not put under him; but now we ſee not yet all things put under him.</hi> That is, we ſee not yet the Kingdoms of this World, become the Kingdoms of our God, and of his Chriſt. 9. v.<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45720:144"/>
                     <hi>But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the ſuffering of Death, crowned with Glory and Honour.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith much the ſame words, in
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27,28. And it is alſo ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12.
<hi>This man, after he had offered one Sacrifice for Sin, for ever ſate down on the Right Hand of God,</hi> 13. v. <hi>From henceforth expecting, till his Enemies be made his Footſtool.</hi> This ever, ſignifies, whilſt this our World laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; all which time he expecteth till his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his Footſtool; but by theſe words it is fully Evident to us, that his Enemies are not made his Footſtool.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>David</hi> was a Type of Chriſt, and he was anointed King, whereby he was aſſured of the Kingdom, a long time before he received the Power of the Kingdom. But his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers knowing him to be the Lord's Anointed, owned him to be their Prince and King, when he was not in the Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom; but at the time God had determined, he removed his Enemies, and ſet him on the Throne of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> his People. So Chriſt, will not have only his ſuffering time, with
<hi>David</hi> here, where none but a few ſhall own him to be their Prince and King: But alſo his Reigning time on the Throne of his Father
<hi>David;</hi> at which time all his Enemies ſhall be made his Footſtool; and then it is, that all the Kingdoms of this World ſhall become the Kingdoms of our God, and of his Chriſt.</p>

<hi>weeping, for her Children, refuſed to be comforted for her Children, becauſe they were not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee, that this is ſpoken of, as tho it were already done and paſt, altho it was about five hundred years, before this Propheſy was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulfil'd, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Then</hi> Herod, <hi>when he ſaw that he was mocked of the Wiſe Men, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wrath, and ſent forth, and ſlew all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were in</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>and in all the Coaſt thereof, from two years old, and under, according to the time which he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently inquired of the Wiſe men.</hi> 17. v. <hi>Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Prophet, ſaying,</hi> 18. v. <hi>In</hi> Ramah <hi>was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping, and great mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they are not.</hi> Now

And alſo theſe things gives us light how to read the Scriptures, as I before told you. That thoſe Propheſies, and Sayings in Scripture, which ſpeak as if they were already done, if we do not find they are done, it remaineth good to us, they ſhall be done.</p>

                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:45720:147"/>Now although the Lord did ſay, all power was given him in Heaven and in Earth; yet the Lord, to let us underſtand that his time was not yet, ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>His Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> Therefore the Lord Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in

And the Apoſtle tells us,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11,12,13,18. That our Life here, muſt be a continual Warfare. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. And that the Saints are but ſtrangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims upon the Earth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8,9. <hi>And that we have an Adverſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about ſeeking whom he may devour.

<hi>To be fervent in Prayer, ſerving the Lord.</hi> And to do this, let us not go out in our own ſtrength, but with ſtrong Crying and Prayers unto our God, that we may be able to ſtand in the evil Day. And St. <hi>John</hi> perſwades us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15,16,17. <hi>not to love the World, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things that are in the World.

<hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole World lyeth in Wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all theſe Warnings and Admonitions were given us by the Apoſtles, in the height of Chriſt's Spiritual Kingdom, when there was ſuch wonderful pourings forth of the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking with Tongues, Healing all manner of Diſeaſes, caſting out Devils; and on whomſoever they laid their Hands, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Colloſians, The Goſpel had been Preached through the World.</hi> Yet <hi>Satan</hi> was not then bound up, for he ſaith, He ſent a Meſſenger of his to Buffet him. All which is to inform us, his Power will continue to the end of this<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45720:148"/>World: That is, till Chriſt comes to Judg the World. And then he ſhall be bound up, and the wicked receive their Condemnation, and all things reſtored to their firſt purity. And not that he was bound up in the Apoſtles time, till after the Reign of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great: For the Emperor turning Chriſtian, had ſo loaded the Church with Honours and Riches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they abounded with Pride; whereupon their Contentions grew ſo hot one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the good Emperor could not allay their Feuds, ſo that he removed his Throne to
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by which removing his Court from <hi>Rome,</hi> made way for the Riſe of the beaſt, which is made mention of by St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> whereas he ſaith in 2 <hi>Theſ</hi> 2.7. <hi>The miſtery of iniquity doth already work, only he, who now letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way.</hi> By which words we may plainly ſee, that the Devil was not bound; for he tells us, the Myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was already working, in carrying on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to ſet the Beaſt upon the Throne; altho it was not fully accompliſht till about two hundred years after the Departure of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror from <hi>Rome;</hi> and he was daily increaſing in his Power, and the more by the Vacancy of the Throne; which was one cauſe of his getting up into that Peſtilential Chair. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the forementioned Chapter, 8. v. <hi>Then ſhall the wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume, with the Spirit of his Mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his Coming.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here we are fully inform'd when the Beaſt ſhall be deſtroyed. That is, when the Lord cometh to Judg the World, whom he then will deſtroy with the Breath of his Mouth, and with the brightneſs of his coming. And &amp; <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20,21. <hi>The Beaſt was takes and with him the falſe Prophet that wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles before him, with which he deceived them the had received the Mark of the Beaſt, and them the Worſhiped his image, theſe were both caſt alive into a Lake of Fire burning with Brimſtone. And the Remnant were ſlain with the Sword of him that ſalt upon the Horſe, which Sword proceeded out of his Mouth, and all the Fowls were filled with their Fleſh.</hi> And he ſaith,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1,2,3. <hi>He ſaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the Key of the Bottomleſs Pit, and a great Chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years, and caſt him into the Bottomleſs Pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a Seal upon him, that he ſhould not deceive the Nations no more, till the Thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled; after that, he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon.</hi>

                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:45720:149"/>The next verſe treats of the Raiſing of the Saints, by which we ſee, the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (as I before ſhewed) do all agree, that the deſtroying of the Beaſt, the Judgment of the World, the binding of Satan, and the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints, to be all at one and the ſame time, and that time will be at the coming of the Lord: And it is ſaid that the Beaſt and the Falſe Prophet, theſe both were caſt alive into the Lake of Fire, burning with Brimſtone; whilſt the others that are Slain, their Carkaſſes lay for the Fowls to be filled with their Fleſh; all this is ſet down to be done when the Lord again comes. Now the

<hi>Peter</hi> doth plainly ſpeak much to the like Effect, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3.3. of the Chriſtians declining, and falling from their Purity, and not of an inlargement before the Coming of the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.21. <hi>And our Lord, being demanded of the Phariſees, when the Kingdom of God ſhould come, he anſwered them and ſaid, the Kingdom of God cometh not with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi> That is, appeareth not with Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, or Greatneſs.
<hi>For they ſhall not ſay, lo here, or lo there, for behold, the Kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</hi> As much as to ſay, I have no other Throne, or Kingdom here, but where I am In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thron'd in the Heart, is all the Throne I have in this World. And in <hi>John</hi> 16.33. The Lord<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45720:150"/>ſaith, <hi>In the World ye ſhall have Tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the World.</hi> And the Apoſtle to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. what dreadful Afflictions the Church ſuffered in the old time, <hi>knowing here they had no continuing City, but they ſought one that was to come.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7,8. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and Scourgeth ever Son whom he receiveth. If ye endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with Sons, for what Son is he whom the Father Chaſtneth not? But if ye be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are you Baſtards, and not Sons.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> in his
<hi>Revelations</hi> tells us, what dreadful Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Church of Chriſt would ſuffer, even to the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13,14. <hi>And when the Dragon ſaw that he was caſt into the Earth, he Perſecuted the Woman. And to the Woman were given two great Wings of an Eagle, that ſhe might fly into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the Serpent. And the Serpent caſt out of his Mouth waters as a Flood after the Woman, that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the Flood. And the Earth helped the Woman, and the Earth opened her Mouth, and ſwallowed up the Flood, which the Dragon caſt out of his Mouth. And the Dragon was wrath with the Woman, and went to make War with the remnant of her Seed, which kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:45720:150"/>Now by the Wings of a great Eagle, is meant Support and Aſſiſtance; and by Waters, is comprehended Afflictions, and the Men that are the Afflictors, by what the Prophet <hi>David</hi> faith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The Floods of ungodly men made me afraid. From theſe Waters the Earth helped the Woman, for the Earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed them up.</hi> That is, takes them away by Death; yet ſtill the Devil Perſiſts in his Malice, for he goes to make War with the Remnant of her Seed. By all this, it is made clearly to appear that Chriſt's Church was a ſuffering Church, is a ſuffering Church, and ſo will continue to the end of this World; and the Lord, to incourage us, tells the Church in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>That if they keep the word of his Patience, he alſo will keep them from the hour of Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the World, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</hi> Here we ſee is a general Tryal, and the Lord to comfort us, ſaith, in the 11. v. <hi>Behold I come quickly, hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we may plainly ſee that the Glory will be prepared for them that Love him, when he comes the ſecond time; for the Glory is not now in this our World, for Chriſt's Church. And when we Pray for Chriſt to have here in this World a Glorious Church, we Pray againſt the determined will of God. But whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now we muſt take notice of the words of the Apoſtle, which tells us, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to himſelf a Glorious Church, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing: Not that he hath ſo preſented it, or that it is ſo preſented, but the word is, That he may preſent it a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Church, without having ſpot or wrinkle: Then the queſtion is here, when it ſhall be? to which I Anſwer, it will be at the great Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Supper of the Lamb, the which will be when the Lord comes.

<hi>Matt.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Behold I have told you before.</hi> 26.
<hi>Wherefore, if they ſhall ſay unto you, behold, he is in the deſert, go not forth. Behold, he is in the ſecret Chambers, believe it not.</hi> 27. v. <hi>For as the Lightning cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth

<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Gloriouſly. And then, as to what the New Heavens and Earth will be, will then be made manifeſt. Whereas the Lord ſaith in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Immediately after the Tribulation of thoſe days ſhall the Sun be darkned, and the Moon ſhall not give her light, and the Stars ſhall fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> By theſe, that is, the Sun, Moon and Stars; and the Powers of Heaven being ſhaken, hath its refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of certain, as to what I before ſhewed you: But theſe words may admit of a two fold meaning, and not only comprehend the Popiſh Miniſtery, and others, that have been negligent in their places, and the wicked powers, but alſo when the Lord cometh, there may be a great Eclipſe, of the Sun, and the Moon may change her Colour, and thoſe wandring Stars fall from Heaven, which Satan has influence on, as to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the darkneſs of this World by. And as St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith in the 13. v. <hi>Where he compareth the wicked to the raging Waves of the Sea, foaming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And likewiſe he compares them to wandring Stars, for whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi> Now as there is the real Waves of the Sea, we ſee here that the Wicked are the Figurative Waves of the Sea. And as there is real wandring Stars that Satan has Influence on, to help him, in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the darkneſs of this World: So there is Figurative Wandering Stars, the which do<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45720:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>darken the light of the Word; and ſo the World, that is, the people is darkned thereby. For which, both the real and figurative Stars, are reſerved, the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.

                  <p>Now, whereas St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>John.</hi> 2.8.
<hi>The darkneſs is past, and the true light now ſhineth.</hi> Which was the true Light then broke forth in the Church, as to Knowledg and Love; but as to the latter, it hath a more particular reference; for he ſo explains himſelf in the 9. v. in that he ſaith, <hi>He that hateth his Brother is in darkneſs.</hi> And in the 10. v. he ſaith, <hi>He that loveth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abideth in the Light.</hi>

<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12,13. <hi>The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand, let us therefore caſt off the works of Darkneſs, and let us put on the Armour of Light. Let us walk honeſtly, as in the day, not in rioting &amp; drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envy.</hi> Here the Apoſtle fully declares, that it was then night, but that he would have them walk as the Children<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45720:152"/>of the day, in which day there will be no ſuch thing committed, at which time, according to the ſaying of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> That all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed of the Lord; and alſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48.31.
<hi>Zach.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.40.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what the Lord ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. c. 24.
<hi>That</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall fall by the edge of the Sword, and ſhall be led away captive into all Nations: and Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fullfilled.</hi> Which is, as I before told you, not until the Gentile Power is quite vanquiſhed; the which will be when the Lord comes; and then will <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be gloriouſly built, never more to be deſtroyed, as it is written, 25. v.
<hi>And there ſhall be ſigns in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the Waves roaring.</hi> 26. v. <hi>Mens Hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the Earth: for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> 27. v. <hi>Then ſhall they ſee the ſon of man coming in a Cloud with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great glory.</hi> 28. v. <hi>And when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then loob up, and lift up your heads, for your Redemption draweth uigh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Words of our Lord admit of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Comfort to the Saints. And in all theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places, the Lord makes no mention of the damned being raiſed at his coming. And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi>
21.31,32. <hi>When ye ſee theſe things come to paſs, know ye that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</hi> 32. v. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45720:153"/>unto you, this Generation ſhall not paſs away till all theſe things be fullfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we ſee by theſe Words, that the Lord doth aſſure us, that he will come in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which words of the Lord is confirmed to us by the Evangeliſts. But you may ſay, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the meaning of the Lord, in his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he would come, before this Generation ſhall paſs away; and ſince that, there has been ſo many Generations, and the Lord is not yet come. As to the meaning of this Generation, the Pſalmiſt himſelf makes it fully out to us in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 12.7. v. wherein he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep them, O Lord, thou ſhalt preſerve them from this generation for ever.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, ſuch a wicked ſort of people as is now, ſhall continue ever: That is, the ever of this World, or as long as that laſteth. In which, all the Wicked God looks upon as one generation, being guilty of one and the ſame ſins; as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, Adultery, Fornication, Falſe Swearing, Prophanation of the Sabbath, Druokenneſs, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Deceit, making a man an Offender for a Word, and upon all Occaſions their flight is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Refuge of Lies. That whereſoever ye hear any almoſt run down, ſo as though they were not fit to live upon the Earth, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they are the Innocent Party; for they that are in the Wrong, think to carry off all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them with their Lies; whilſt the Innocent and Righteous, are loth to ſpeak the worſt they know of their Adverſaries; taking Example by their Lord and Maſter. And like the Angel in<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45720:153"/>St. <hi>Jude,</hi> durſt not bring a Railing Accuſation againſt the Devil; but ſaid, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee;</hi> Whilſt the Wicked are raiſing all their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to broach their Clamour of their own Inventions, through Town and Countrey. But the Lord ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.17. <hi>Judgment will I lay to the Line, and Righteouſneſs to the Plummet; and the Hail ſhall ſweep away the Refuge of Lies.</hi> The which being the ſtorm that at laſt ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them all away. This Scripture hath its ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reference to the time when the Lord cometh, by the Hail that is here mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Now it is juſt with us Chriſtians, as it was with the
<hi>Jews</hi> when the Lord firſt came; that was, they thought themſelves ſecure enough, they being of the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> So the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Chriſtians think themſelves ſafe enough, in that they are baptized, and go by the Name of Chriſtians, and are of the Outward Church; They reſt there, and think they need not concern themſelves any farther. Not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that alſo they muſt put on Chriſt, and thereby become New Creatures; or elſe it will avail them nothing. And another ſort there are, that think, that if they get but themſelves into a ſeparate Congregation, and fancy themſelves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, they then think themſelves paſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The which will prove but ſelf-deceiving. And like that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who fancied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe, becauſe they were of the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as to the ſure Rule, the which is War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45720:154"/>by Scripture, to bring us to Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is, That God requires of us our true Love to himſelf, above all other; with a filial Fear of his Majeſty continually before our Eyes, and in a holy Reſignation of our Wills to his Law; and ſo to walk in ſincere Obedience unto him. The which, if we ſo do, and ſo continue to do, the Lord will give us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8 at his appearing (as it is written) <hi>a Crown rf Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> for the Lord died not to ſave us in our ſins, but to ſave us from our ſins; that ſin might not reign in our mortal bodies, to fulfil it in the Luſt thereof. That is, not to give liberty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny known ſin, let it be never ſo near, or dear to us.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I before ſhewed you, God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Wicked of this World as One Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And again, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> makes it out, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.28,29. There ſpeaking of Chriſts glorious Kingdom, he ſaith in the 30. v. <hi>A Seed ſhall ſerve him, and it ſhall be accounted to him for a Generation.</hi> Although to our way of reckoning, and the Scriptures common way of reckoning, are many Generations. But being made partakers of one Bleſſedneſs, therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of the Lord but as One Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>David</hi> again ſpeaking of the time to come, ſaith, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 24.5,6. <hi>He ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſneſs from the God of his ſalvation.</hi> 6.
<hi>This is the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that ſeek him: that ſeek thy Face, O
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45720:154"/>Jacob. Selah.</hi> And the Lord again terms all the Wicked of this World as One Generation, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.8. <hi>For the Children of this World are in their Generation wiſer than the Children of Light.</hi> And the Lord ſaith to the like effect, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.24,25.
<hi>For as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under Heaven, ſhineth unto the other part under Heaven, ſo ſhall alſo the Son of man be in his day.</hi> 25. v. <hi>But he muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of this Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord tells us of the viſible Glory that he ſhall have in his day, which is the day in which he ſhall Judge the World, which is the day of the Thouſand Years. But firſt, he faith, he muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of this Generation. Wherein, by this
<hi>Generation,</hi> he includes the Wicked of this World, which will continue till he again comes.</p>
                  <p>And having further proof of this in <hi>Tob.</hi> 14.5. where he declared to his Son, before his Death, <hi>That again God would have mercy on them, and bring them again into their own Land, where they ſhould build a Temple, but not like the firſt, until the time of that Age he fullfilled.</hi> That is, that Generation, or that Age, or ſuch a ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their time be accompliſht. After which he ſaith, They ſhould return from all places of their Captivity, and build up <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. The Lord foreſeeing what Darkneſs we were like to fall under, and in eſpecial manner as to that concerning his coming; and therefore the Lord doth aſſure us, he will come in this<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45720:155"/>Generation. After which he ſaith, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but his word ſhall not paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> That is, the Wicked Powers and People ſhall paſs away. Of which the Lord, for our better inlightning, tells us, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.52. <hi>That every Scribe that is well inſtructed, bringeth out of his Treaſury, things New and Old.</hi> That is, for the better underſtanding of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, we muſt ſearch the Old. For indeed, they both give light, the one to the other. And as to the meaning of the Lord, in his ſaying this generation, I was ignorant of, how to apprehend it. And being formerly asked by a Gentleman, that had no belief of the Bible, how I could, ſince my Lord had ſo falfyfied his word in his promiſe, as concerning his coming in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and ſince there has been ſo many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the Lord is not yet come. At which time, I could not give him a ſatisfactory anſwer, neither any that could prove ſo to my ſelf. At which I was much troubled, altho it did no way ſhake my belief in the Lord; as not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the Son of God; and as being ſo he had made ſatisfaction for all them that truly love and fear him, for through Mercy I had had thoſe Experiences of the Lord unto me, that I was not ſtaggered therein, notwithſtanding my trouble was very great, that my Lord ſhould be termed a Deceiver, in being worſe than his word. After which a conſiderable time, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Earth-quakes, and the Cities of the Nations falling, I thought it my beſt way to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45720:155"/>take the Lords Advice, and ſearch the Scriptures with more diligence than ever, and I earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord with Prayers, that he would inlighten my Underſtanding therein. And bleſſed be God, he hath granted my requeſt; and not only ſo, but having found out theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, the which are, and will be, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſſes to my Lord, to prove that he hath not falſified his word to us, in the Promiſe of his Coming, but that he will certainly come in this Generation, whoſe coming is juſt at hand, which will be the day in which Chriſt will Judg the World, and give rewards to his Servants, at which time there will be none of theſe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Eſaras</hi> ſaith, they ſhall be changed, 2 <hi>Eſd.</hi> 6.26,27. <hi>The men that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſhall ſee it, who have not taſted Death from their Birth, and the Hearts of the Inhabitants ſhall be changed, and turned into another meaning; for evil ſhall be put out, deceit ſhall be quenched, as for faith it ſhall flouriſh, and corruption ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and truth, which hath been ſo long without fruit, ſhall be declared.</hi> Then will the ſaying of the Angel, to the Bleſſed Virgin, be made good, concerning Chriſt, as in
<hi>Luke</hi> 1.32,33. <hi>He ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the Throne of his Father</hi> David. <hi>And he ſhall reign over the Houſe of</hi> Jacob
<hi>for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> Now the Throne of his Father <hi>David</hi> was on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Nathanael,</hi> in
<hi>John</hi> 1.51.<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45720:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Hereafter you ſhall ſee Heaven open, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God aſcending, and deſcending upon the Son of Man.</hi> When this eminent Glory of Chriſt ſhall be Revealed, then alſo will come to paſs the ſaying of the Apoſtle, as in
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>That in the Ages to come he might ſhew the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Riches of his grace, in his kindneſs toward us, through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This exceeding Riches of the Grace of Chriſt, will be manifeſted toward them in the World to come: Of which World to come, ſhall proceed Ages and Generations, And God ſaith of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.17,18. <hi>Iſrael ſhall be ſaved in the Lord, with an everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ye ſhall not be aſhamed nor confounded World without end. For thus ſaith the Lord that Created the Heavens, God himſelf that formed the Earth and made it, he hath eſtabliſhed it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited, I am the Lord, and there is none elſe.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the Church by
<hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. <hi>That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, Laying up in ſtore for themſelves, a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee here is another time ſpoken of, and if it's time, it is then before Eternity, and ſo before the final Judgment, wherein 'tis ſaid, the Sea, Hell and Death ſhall deliver up their Dead. And whereas there is ſpoken of three Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and three Worlds, and three Times, the which three ways of expreſſing, includes one<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45720:156"/>and the ſame thing; and that there will be a time wherein the Glory of the Righteous ſhall be reveal'd, as there has been times wherein they have been deſpiſed; and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8.18,19,20,21,22. <hi>But I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> 19. <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God.</hi> 20. <hi>For the Creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope.</hi> 21. <hi>Becauſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi> 22. <hi>For we know that the whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation groaneth, and travelleth in pain together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in the uſual Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture way, in that he mentions that which is to come, as tho it were then preſent, the which by his following words he doth ſo explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as in the 23. v. where he ſaith, <hi>And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, even we our ſelves, groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our Body.</hi>
24. <hi>For we are ſaved by hope; but hope that is ſeen, is not hope; for what a man ſeeth, why doth he hope for?</hi> 25. <hi>But if we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wait for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As concerning this Hope, the Lord puts forth the Parable in
<hi>Luke</hi> 19.12,16,17. <hi>He ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45720:157"/>a certain noble man went out into a far country to receive for himſelf a kingdom, and to return.</hi> By this we ſee the Lord was to return again, when he had received the Power of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and then he will give here rewards to his Servants, according to their diligence, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in his Service, as in the 16. and 17. v. <hi>Then came the first, ſaying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. And he ſaid unto him, well, thou good ſervant; becauſe thou haſt been faithful in a very little, have thou Authority over ten Cites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we ſee, according to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Talent he gives us, ſo will his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be, for the God of Judgment will not be ſuch a partial Judg, as ſome has thought him: But the Judg of all the World will do right. Now by the Parable that the Lord put forth, concerning the Wedding Supper, I find therein is Comfort for the Poor; for when thoſe that were bidden, were not found worthy, through their own neglect, and ſo was detain'd from coming, through the Love they had to this preſent World, as in
<hi>Matt.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Then ſaid the King to his Servants, the Wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.</hi> 9. <hi>Go ye therefore into the High-ways, and as many as ye ſhall find bid to the Marriage.</hi>
10. <hi>So thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants went into the high-ways, and gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, as many as they could find, both good and bad, and the Wedding was furniſhed with gueſts.</hi> 11. <hi>And when the King came in to ſee the gueſts, he ſaw there a man, which had not a Wedding Garment.</hi> 12.
<hi>And<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45720:157"/>he ſaid unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding Garment, and he was ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi> 13.
<hi>Then ſaid the King to the Servants, bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and caſt him into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth.</hi> We ſee, that although the poor in great number at the laſt day, will be called in to be made partakers of that bleſſedneſs which then ſhall be revealed; yet we ſee by this one that has been mentioned, that ſome of them will be caſt out, and that there will be ſomething found in them, which will unfit them for mercy. That is, their Lives more eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God, and their tempers more united to Satan; like to this Man in the Parable, which might, like the Glory of the Saints, yet not their Sanctity, or they ſound guilty of ſome of thoſe crying ſins unrepented of. And whereas the Lord ſaith in the 14. v. <hi>For many are called but few are choſen.</hi> That is, they are called, ſo as to be brought into the knowledg of God and his ways, as to know what he requires of us: But by reaſon they will not uſe their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make their Calling and Election ſure, therefore they will not be choſen in the great day of the Lord; the which the foregoing words doth make it ſo out, that they did neglect the tender and offer of mercy by his Meſſengers, in, or of the Goſpel; being not willing to forego this preſent World, and therefore are not ſound ready when the Lord comes, ſo as then to be choſen by him. And alſo if we neglect the<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45720:158"/>tender of mercy all our Life time, I can find no hopes that ſuch ſhould be choſen upon a Death-Bed. As for the Thief upon the Croſs, he was not brought into the knowledg of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time. And the Lord ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21,22,23.
<hi>When thoſe that were bidden came not, then the Maſter of the Houſe being angry, ſaid to his Servants, go out quickly into the Streets and Lanes of the City, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. And the ſervant ſaid, Lord, it is done as thou commanded, and yet there is room. And the Lord ſaid to the ſervant, go out into the high-ways and hedges and compel them to come in, that my houſe may be full.</hi> Now as to the meaning of theſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Lord, in which they are bidden to Supper, is his Invitation to us by the Goſpel, which remains good from the time of his being on Earth, till his ſecond coming; at which time, he not finding thoſe that were bidden, prepared for his coming; therefore in the 24. v. ſaith, <hi>That none of thoſe men that were bidden, ſhall taſt of my Supper.</hi> That is, thoſe that are not found prepared. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.8. Where the Lord ſaith, <hi>When he cometh, ſhall he find faith on Earth.</hi> That is, the generality of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will be more prophane and wicked than ever they were; and therefore none of them that are ſo, ſhall have any part of his Supper when he cometh.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the juſtice and mercy of God might be both evident, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> and<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45720:158"/>St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. Where he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God ſaith, in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.4. <hi>That thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and mighteſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when thou art judged.</hi> Therefore God looking on the poor, that here have known nothing but miſery, and thereby made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſhewing mercy, in giving relief to others; and alſo through poverty had not the due education, as to bring them up in the knowledge of the Lord, of which ſome of them which will be brought in at the coming of the Lord, is ſaid to be lame, halt, and blind. To be ſure, ſome of them will not be only outwardly ſo, but alſo, there will be thoſe that are inwardly ſo. The firſt that were brought in are ſaid to be fetcht out of the ſtreets, and lanes of the City: And the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord, ſaid, yet there is room. Then were they Commanded to go into the high waies, and hedges, and to compel them to come in. Here by all this, we have no reaſon to believe that theſe were all ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at his coming, but that they then are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to ſill up their places that have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his mercy. And
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> Propheſieth of the time to come, in which the Lord ſhall be judge, that the lame alſo ſhall take the prey. Whereas he ſaith, in Chap. 33.22. v. <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord ic our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us.</hi> 23. v. <hi>Thy tackling are looſed, they could not well ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their Maſt, they could not ſpread the Sail
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45720:159"/>then is the prey of a great ſpoile divided, the lame take the prey.</hi> You may plainly ſee by theſe words, that they have only reference to the time, when the Lord again comes. And in the 14 Chap. 1. v.
<hi>For the Lord will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on</hi> Jacob, <hi>and will yet chuſe</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſet them in their own Land, and ſtrangers ſhall be joyned with them, and they ſhall cleave to the houſe of</hi> Jacob. By which we ſee that there will be ſtrangers called in at that time when

9.17,18,19. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God.</hi> Then it is in the following verſe, <hi>The needy ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way be forgotten, the expectation of the poor ſhall not periſh for ever. Ariſe, O Lord, let not man prevail, let the Heathen be judged in thy ſight.</hi> We ſee here when it is that the Poor and Needy is thus to be remembred: It is when the Lord riſeth to judgment, at which time he renders puniſhments to the Wicked, and Comfort to the Afflicted. And it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way, becauſe of the man who bringeth wicked deviſes to paſs.</hi> 8.
<hi>Ceaſe from anger, and forſake wrath; fret not thy ſelf in any wiſe to do evil.</hi> 9. <hi>For evil doers ſhall be cut off, but thoſe that wait upon the Lord, they ſhall inherit the Earth,</hi> 10. <hi>For yet a little while, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall not be.</hi> 11. <hi>But the meek ſhall inherit the Earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.</hi> 12. <hi>The wicked plotteth againſt the juſt,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45720:159"/>and gnaſheth upon him with his Teeth.</hi> 13. <hi>The Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming.</hi> 22.
<hi>For ſuch as be bleſſed of him ſhall inherit the Earth, and they that are curſed of him ſhall be cut off.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid,
<hi>He that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Poor lendeth to the Lord.</hi> And the Lord calleth the Poor his Brethren. And the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World, to confound the Wiſe, and God hath choſen the weak things af the world, to confound the things that are mighty.</hi> 28. <hi>And the baſe things of the World, and the things that are deſpiſed, hath God choſen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> You ſee, in theſe laſt words of the verſe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a reference for the time to come. And as the Lord, at his firſt coming, did chuſe the mean and low things of the Earth: So at the Lord's ſecond coming it does appear that he will then chuſe them alſo, as part of his Elect, when he again comes. 29. <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi> That is, It is not their Wiſdom, Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, or Greatneſs that made them acceptable with God. Of which
<hi>Hanath</hi> Propheſieth in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He raiſed up the Poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghil, to ſet them among Princes, and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory; for the Pillars of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the World upon them.</hi>
9. <hi>He will keep the feet of his Saints, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be ſilent in darkneſs; for by ſtrength ſhall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45720:160"/>ſhall be broken to pieces; out of Heaven ſhall he thunder upon them; the Lord ſhall judg the ends of the Earth, and he ſhall give ſtrength unto his King, and exalt the Horn of his Anointed.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 31. <hi>That, according as it is written, he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> And
<hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23,24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches. But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord which exerciſe loving Kindneſs, Judgment and Righteouſneſs in the Earth, for in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord.</hi> This Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as the forementioned, to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> has a reference to the ſecond Coming of Chriſt; at which time he will exerciſe Loving Kindneſs, Judgment, and Righteouſneſs in the Earth. Now it does fully appear by Scripture, who are the Elect that will be received into mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when the Lord again comes. That it is the Antient People of God, the Jews, with part of thoſe people or nations which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes mention of in the
60. c. 6. 7. v. And the poor which have not uncapacitated themſelves for Mercy. There is alſo then a Bleſſing promiſed to the Meek,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11. <hi>They ſhall inherit the Earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Peace,</hi> which cannot be till the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45720:160"/>comes. That is, thoſe meek that have not had the Opportunity of more knowledg. And the Merciful, that have ſhewed mercy to Gods Elect, if they have not been guilty of the evils againſt which the Lord hath pronounc'd that dreadful ſentence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>That they ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I hope God, of his infinite mercy, hath here cauſed the true meaning of his Word to break forth, to be the means of ſaving of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor Papiſts and Turks. And I hope it will awaken thouſands of our Nations, that are aſleep in ſecurity, before they ſleep that ſleep of Eternal Death. But as for them that are willfully ignorant, there remains for them no hopes of Mercy. For God ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi>
1.24,25,26,27,28. <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</hi> 25. v. <hi>But ye have ſet at nought all my Counſel, and would none of my Reproof.</hi> 26. v.
<hi>I will alſo laugh at your Calamity, I will mock when your Fear cometh.</hi> 27. v. <hi>When your Fear cometh as Deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a Whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you.</hi> 28. v. <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer: they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me.</hi> According to the ſaying of the Lord, in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> That they ſhall then ſtrive to enter in, but ſhall not be able. That is, as ſoon as the Lord appeareth, they will be ſeeking to <pb n="122" facs="tcp:45720:161"/>him for Mercy (for this Scripture doth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly relate to the latter Day), but then it will be too late; <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29. <hi>For that they hated Knowledge, and did not chuſe the Fear of the Lord.</hi> Whilſt the door of Mercy is open to us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make our Calling and Election ſure: For when the Lord comes to Judgment, we muſt then give an account of our Stewardſhip; and as we are found, ſo will our Sentence be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Bleſſedneſs or Miſery. Now the Lord Chriſt, with the Apoſtles, ſpeaks in the ſame method, as God aforetime ſpake by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in that they do mention thoſe things which are to come, as though they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done. And alſo in that they mention, or joyn thoſe things together, which are done, or ſhortly to be done, with thoſe things which are of a long continuance, before they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht. And having proved it in ſeveral places before, I ſhall here make mention but of Two.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the foregoing words of the Apoſtle, wherein he makes mention of thoſe call'd in at Chriſts firſt coming, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Elect, which ſhall be received into mercy at his ſecond coming. And alſo Chriſt himſelf mentioneth the deſtruction of
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with that of the deſtruction of the world, as tho they were to have been at one and the ſame time. That thereby we might the better underſtand the writings of the Prophets, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to their joyning things<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45720:161"/>together, which admits of great diſtance of time between. For as to the Covenant that God made with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Chriſtians were included therein alſo: As being <hi>Ahrahams</hi> ſeed by Chriſt. And therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of
<hi>Iſraels</hi> Land, he there ſpeaks of what will become of the Chriſtians Land. That is, the Land where the pretended head of the Church is, who walk with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to the imagination of their own hearts: Which woe is pronounced to that Land, that it ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come brimſtone, and ſalt, and burning. Alſo thoſe Propheſies of Chriſts firſt coming are joyn'd with his ſecond coming, and many more, as I before ſhewed you. And that in thoſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies there are great diſtances of time between their accompliſhment, although it is ſet down, as though they were ſo near together.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt having left it clear to us by the Event, that the World was not deſtroyed when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was; whereby it makes it plain to our apprehenſions, that thoſe Propheſies had a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning than what the firſt part made out: and what has not been made good, it remains to be made good.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 13.29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. <hi>Behold, the days come, when the moſt High will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to deliver them that are upon the Earth.</hi> 30. v. <hi>He ſhall come to the aſtoniſhment of them that dwell on the Earth.</hi> 31. <hi>And one ſhall undertake to fight againſt another, one City againſt another, one place againſt another, one people againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45720:162"/>one Realm againſt another.</hi> 32. v. <hi>And the time ſhall be, and the Signs ſhall happen, and then ſhall my Son be declared, whom thou ſaweſt as a man aſcending.</hi> 33. v.
<hi>And when all the people hear his Voice, every man ſhall in their own Land leave the Battle they have one againſt another.</hi> 34. v. <hi>And an innumerable multitude ſhall be gathered together, as thou ſaweſt them, willing to come, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him by fighting.</hi> 36. v. <hi>But he ſhall ſtand upon the top of Mount Sion, and Sion ſhall come, and ſhall be ſhewed to all men, being prepared and builded like as thou ſaweſt the Hill graven without hands.</hi> 37. v. <hi>And this my Son ſhall rebuke the wicked Inventions of thoſe Nations, which for their wicked Life are fallen into the Tempeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now without all doubt, this fighting is ſo term'd, as
<hi>Jacobs</hi> Prayers were Wreſtling, when he prevail'd with the Angel; but theſe will not have ſuch ſucceſs: But when they ſee the glory, they will immediately leave the Battle they have one againſt the other, thinking to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Lord by their Prayers; but then it will be too late for them; for then they muſt be judged according to their Deeds done in their body. For then he will lay before them all their wicked Inventions. Now it does certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear that this is the Battle that was to be fought, by every particular. And alſo this War that is now, is produced by thoſe that are ſet down in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16 13. <hi>And I ſaw three unclean Spirits like Frogs, come out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the Beaſt, and out<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45720:162"/>of the mouth of the Falſe Prophet.</hi>
14. v. <hi>For they are the Spirits of Devils working Miracles, which goeth forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and the whole World, to gather them to the Battle of that great Day of God Almighty.</hi> 15. v. <hi>Behold I come as a Thief; bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his Garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this War proceedeth from the Devil, the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet; who have drawn in the Kings and Princes of the Earth with them; ſo as the Devil by his Unclean Spirits hath ſet all the World in an Uproar; as in <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we are to take notice of the words of the <hi>Lord</hi> in
<hi>Joel,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.2. <hi>I will alſo gather all Nations, and will bring them down into the Valley of</hi> Jehoſhaphat,
<hi>and will plead with them there, for my People and for my Heritage</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>whom they have ſcattered among the Nations, and parted my Land.</hi> Now in Scripture, as I have proved to you, all does not ſignify the whole; and ſo the word here makes out, in that the Lord ſaith, He will plead with them there, for his People and for his Heritage <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom they have ſcattered, and parted his Land. Now we know, that it was but part of the Nations that was guilty of ſo doing, therefore juſt at that time there may be but that part Judged. And the words in the 12. v. makes it further ſo appear, for the Lord there ſaith, <hi>Let the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then be wakened, and come up to the Valley of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat, <hi>for there will I ſit to Judg all the Heathen<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45720:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>round about.</hi> That is, thus, All the Heathen round about, that has <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Land in poſſeſſion, and doth Lord it over them: For thoſe of the Heathen, that are here Judged, are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; as it is clear in the two following ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And it is Evident by other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they ſhall have a time of Torment here, before they are caſt into Hell. Now in that they are all here termed Heathens, is according to that of the ſaying of St
<hi>Paul,</hi> He is not a Jew, that is one outwardly; ſo they are not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that only outwardly bear the Name of Chriſt, as Papiſts do; neither do they know God, which the <hi>Turks</hi> pretend to do; yet in works deny him, and Worſhip <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Therefore theſe, in the ſight of God, appear as the worſt of Heathens. Neither could th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now by theſe Heathens, there is none of thoſe Nations comprehended, which the Lord will call in at his coming, becauſe that they are all condemned; but I hope the Almighty God hath at this time ſet our King amongſt them, that he might be the awakener of ten thouſand times ten thouſand of them. And I hope every thinking Soul will conſider what God is going about to do, ſo as to prepare for his coming. And ſince we have been all in great miſtakes, we may the better pity and pray the one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now the Time is juſt at hand. For this<pb n="127" facs="tcp:45720:163"/>being the Exact Battle that is deſcribed, with the Earthquakes that have been in divers places, and the Cities of the Nations falling, with the continual Whirlwinds mentioned in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 30.23,24. At the time that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, God ſaith in the 23. v. <hi>Behold the Whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with Fury, a continuing Whirlwind; it ſhall fall with pain upon the head of the Wicked.</hi> 24. <hi>The fierce Anger of the Lord ſhall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter days ye ſhall conſider it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now it is theſe Whirlwinds of the Lord are gone forth; for War and Afflictious are by the Lord termed Winds, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.1. And alſo the great ſtupidity that is at this day upon the People, according to the Word of the Lord in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. the which is wholly directed unto the Chriſtians, as all the following part of the Chapter, from the 4th ver. makes appear. And the Lord at this time, by weak means, making good that Promiſe in <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.4. <hi>But thou, O Daniel, ſhut up the Words, and ſeal the Book, even till the time of the End. Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Lord having opened his Word, whereby Knowledge may be increaſed; and this he hath done by weak means, that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might the more eminently appear, and the Work to be his own.</p>
                  <p>And as for moſt of the great Judgments ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> they will be upon the<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45720:164"/>Earth after the Lord comes. And as for the drying up the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it was never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, as a ſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his coming. Neither was the Fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> given us as a ſign before the coming of the Lord. But if <hi>Babylon</hi> does fall before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord, it will be upon the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the great Deluſions that is now made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; being accompanied with the Angry Face of Heaven, in the Earthquakes, and fiery Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that have been amongſt them. But if the City, as well as the Beaſt, do remain till the Lord come, at which time,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.11,12. <hi>The Beaſt will be deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame, and then the reſt of the Beaſt, or Kings, will have their Dominion taken away; Yet their Lives will be prolonged for a Seaſon and a Time.</hi> Then may the Kings that gave their Power to the Beaſt, when they become ſenſible of the intolerable Vengeance that they are fallen under; then may they make good that which is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. <hi>And the Ten Horns which thou ſaweſt upon the Beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the Whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the deſtruction of this City, there is no other mentioned, but them that had given their Power to the Beaſt. And what is faid here, and in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and what the Lord in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8. where he ſpeaks concerning his Invitation to us by the Goſpel, it doth not appear to be after the<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45720:164"/>Lord comes, for it is ſaid in the 5. v.
<hi>They made light of it, and went their ways, one to his Farm, another to his Merchandiſe.</hi> 6. v. <hi>And the remnant took his Servants, and intreated them deſpightfully, and ſlew them.</hi> 7. v. <hi>But when the King hear'd thereof he was wrath, and ſent forth his Armies, and deſtroyed thoſe Murderers, and burnt up their City.</hi> Now we here have had the Call of the Goſpel, and neglected it. But it has, and is the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, that does take the Servants of Chriſt, and uſe them deſpightfully, and ſlay them; for which it is ſaid, that the King ſent his Armies, and deſtroyed thoſe Murderers, and burnt up their City. Now the Murderers being ſaid to be deſtroyed when the City is burnt up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth more clearly appear to be after the Lord comes. And the Lord hath inform'd us of this City by St.
<hi>John,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. That it is miſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> as in the 5. v. <hi>And upon her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was a Name written, Miſtery,</hi> Babylon <hi>the great, the Mother of Harlots, and abominations of the Earth.</hi> Here the Lord mentions this City under the Name of a Woman. And in the following verſe it is ſaid. And I ſaw the Woman Drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus, and when I ſaw her I wondred with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.1. <hi>I ſaw an angel come down from Heaven.</hi> 2. <hi>And he cryed mightily with a ſtrong Voice, ſaying,</hi> Babylon <hi>the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and the hold of every foul Spirit, and a cage of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45720:165"/>every unclean and hateful bird. This being the ſame,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.10. and ſo to the end. And in the forementioned Chapter of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> 3. v.
<hi>For all Nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her Fornication, and the Kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her.</hi> And in the 4. v. <hi>And I heard another voice from Heaven, ſaying, come out of her my People, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not of her plagues.</hi> 5. <hi>v. For her ſins have reached unto Heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquity.</hi> 6. <hi>v. Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her works, in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double.</hi> 7. <hi>v. How much ſhe hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her, for ſhe ſaith in her heart, I ſit a Queen, and am no Widow, and ſhall ſee no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> 8. v. <hi>Therefore ſhall her Plagues come in one day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire; for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi> Now that we might not be miſtaken, as to the City, her Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe makes it clearly out, where it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.13,17,18. She makes Merchandiſe of the Souls of men. And in the 17. c. by the Angels words we are fully aſſured which this City is. For in the 18. v. he ſaith, <hi>The Woman which thou ſaweſt, is the great City, which reigneth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:45720:165"/>Now by this demonſtration here, it is fully made evident, that this City here mentioned is <hi>Rome,</hi> in that no City under the face of the whole Heavens, can be ſaid to Reign over the Kings of the Earth, but <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhe doth, by her Pope and Cardinals, and the reſt of her Crew, which are there ſituated. And alſo of this City or Woman it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.4. <hi>She was arrayed in Purple, and Scarlet Colour, and deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Gold and Precious Stones and Pearls, having a Golden Cup in her Hand, full of Abominations, and the filth of her Fornications.</hi> This Cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another clear proof that it is <hi>Rome</hi> that is here ment; for it is ſaid, in the Cup is the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and the filth of her Fornications: The which ſhe ſets up as a God, and Worſhips, and with which ſhe commits Spiritual Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And now having ſhewed you who this City is, I leave her to her near approaching Judg.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what is ſaid in <hi>Zachariah,</hi> chap. 12.7. v.
<hi>The Lord alſo ſhall ſave the Tents of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah firſt, that the Glory of the Houſe of David, and the Glory of the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, do not magnifie themſelves againſt Judah.</hi> Now the houſe of
<hi>David</hi> came of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and they were the Chief of that Tribe; and yet here 'tis ſaid, that they ſhould not magnifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt <hi>Judah:</hi> and therefore underneath theſe Words, appears there's ſomething veil'd; and the true Chriſtians come in by the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> and therefore it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

And in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8,9,10. verſes, it is ſaid,
<hi>In that day ſhall the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and he that is feeble among them at that day ſhall be as</hi> David, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord before them.</hi> 9. v.
<hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that I will ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Nations that come againſt</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. 10. v. <hi>And I will pour upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of Grace and Supplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his onely Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt born.</hi> Here in theſe verſes the Lord tells us, that at the reſtoration of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the weak Saint ſhall be as the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhall be as God. That is, as <hi>David</hi> was King over them, ſo will Chriſt the Lord, who is as God. And then ſhall they ſee him whom they have pierced. As alſo it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Behold he cometh with the Clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him; and they alſo which pierced him, and all the Kindreds of the Earth ſhall wail becauſe of him.</hi> Now it will be when the Lord comes in the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45720:166"/>that they ſhall ſee him whom they have pierced. And the people ſhall mourn apart, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12. <hi>The land ſhall mourn, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Family apart, the Family of the houſe of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>apart, and their wives apart, the Family of the houſe of</hi> Nathan <hi>apart, and their wives apart.</hi> 13. v. <hi>The Family of the houſe of</hi> Levy <hi>apart, and their wives apart, the Family of</hi> Shinei <hi>apart, and their wives apart, all the Families that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, every Family apart, and their wives apart.</hi> Here we ſee there is no mention made of the Mourning of them of
<hi>Juda,</hi> which is ſpoken of in the 7. v. by which it does more plainly appear to be the true Chriſtians, they coming in by the Lyon of the Tribe of
<hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is ſaid in <hi>Eſdras</hi> 5.8. <hi>There ſhall be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion alſo in many places, and fire ſhall be oft ſent out again.</hi> Which Word of the Lord is made good, by the often repeated fires that he has lately ſent out of Mount <hi>Etna,</hi> and <hi>Veſivius.</hi> And it is now according to what is ſaid in <hi>Eſdras</hi> 5.12. <hi>At the ſame time ſhall men hope, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing obtain; they ſhall labour, but their ways ſhall not proſper.</hi> And alſo it is ſaid in
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 6.24. <hi>At that time ſhall Friends fight one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Enemies, and the Earth ſhall ſtand in fear with thoſe that dwell therein; the Springs of the Fountains ſhall ſtand ſtill, and in three hours they ſhall not run.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid the Earth ſhall ſtand in fear with thoſe that dwell therein. Which Earth, is the Earth of people, which ſtands<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45720:167"/>in fear of thoſe Armies which are amongſt them. And as for the Springs of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſtanding ſtill, they did ſo at <hi>Taur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> and thereabouts, in the year 1694. And alſo the Springs of Water were ſtopt for ſome time in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> in the great Earthquake.</p>
                  <p>This Book of <hi>Eſdras</hi> has been laid aſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they apprehended not the Reſtoration of the Jews ſhould be at the Judgment of this World, and their Glory to be in the Renewed Heaven and Earth, at Chriſt's Second Coming. Although it is all along declared to be ſo, both in the Old and New Teſtament; but in ſome places more veil'd. Now this <hi>Eſdras</hi> is the ſame which is called <hi>Ezra,</hi> in that Book ſet down in the Bible before <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> For in <hi>Ezra</hi>
10th chap. the 9, 16, and 17. verſes, is exactly the ſame with that in the firſt Book of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> the 9th chap. 5, 6, 16, and 17. verſes. As to the difference of the Name, the Prophets are not in the New Teſtament named as they are in the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince the Signs are come which the Lord hath given us to prepare our Hearts for him, that thereby we may be continually upon our Watch, longing and waiting for his coming, and that we may be found of him in peace, and not of the Tares that are ſaid in the Parible to be bound in bundles, and caſt into the Fire of Hell. I ſhall now here ſpeak of the new
<hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> which is ſpoken of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in St.
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſaw a new Heaven, and a <pb n="135" facs="tcp:45720:167"/>new Earth:</hi> For he tells us, that the firſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the firſt Earth were paſſed away: And in the 6. c. from the 13. v. to the 17. he tells us there of Stars falling, the Heavens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rolled together; and alſo every Mountain and Iſland were moved out of their places; and the Kings of the Earth, and the great men; the Rich Men, the chief Captains, the mighty men, every bound man, and every free man hid themſelves in Dens and Rocks of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and ſaid to the Rocks and Mountains, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand. I ſhall not here inlarge upon it, becauſe I have already proved it unto you, what are the Heavens that will be rolled together, whilſt the Kings of the Earth, for ſome time remain upon the Earth, to be ruled with a rod of Iron, till daſhed to pieces like a Potters Veſſel. That is, thoſe wicked Kings that have been the Afflictors of the Servants of Chriſt, and ſo continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance until the Lord comes. Here we may ſee that the writings of this Book by this place and others, has been very much miſplaced, in that they have ſet down the great day of the Wrath of the Lamb, and the deſtruction of the World, before the rice of the Beaſt. And in the 14. chap. from the 15. v. to the 20. it treats of the Earth being Reaped, and alſo the Vine of the Earth being reaped, was caſt into
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45720:168"/>the Wine-preſs of the wrath of God, which Wine-preſs was trod without the City. Thus the Earth, with the Vine of the Earth being reaped, are the Heavens and Earth, which are ſaid to paſs away. And in the
20. v. it is ſaid, the Wine-preſs is trod without the City. And in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14,15. it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City. For without are Dogs, and ſorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Idolaters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City here mentioned, being the City ſpoken of in the
14. c. at the 20. v. Where the Wine-preſs is ſaid to be trod without the City. And the 14. chap. is much miſplaced, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is ſet before the Fall of <hi>Babilon.</hi> And alſo the two laſt Chapters are miſplaced, which treats of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in that they have placed them beyond the final and laſt Judgment. For this New
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being the City, without which the Wine-preſs was trod. And without which were Dogs, and Sorcerers. Now had this City been after the final Judgment; it would not have been ſaid, without were whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Idolaters, Sorcerers, and the like; for ſuch being in Hell, have then no ſuch term; for then they are put out of a Capacity of being ſuch any longer. And had this City been in Heaven, as ſome would have it, when the Wine-preſs is trod, it muſt have taken up the whole confine of the Heavens, or otherwiſe the<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45720:168"/>Wine-preſs of God's wrath would appear to be trod in the Heavens without the City: But this being too great an abſurdity, St. <hi>John,</hi> to end all Controverſy, ſaith in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>He ſaw the New</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>coming down from God out of Heaven.</hi> And in the firſt verſe he ſaith, <hi>I ſaw a New Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a New Earth: for the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea.</hi> The New Heavens, and the New Earth, is as I before ſhewed you. The New Powers and New People, in whom dwelleth Righteouſneſs. As Chriſt and his raiſed Saints, the New Heaven, and his Elect, the New Earth. Now whereas he ſaith there was no more Sea. And St. <hi>Jude</hi> terms the wicked, <hi>The Raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own ſhame.</hi> And where the Deſtruction of
<hi>Babilon</hi> is ſpoken of the Multitude that came againſt her, is ſaid to be the Sea, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.42. <hi>The Sea is come up upon</hi> Babilon, <hi>ſhe is covered with the multitude of the Waves thereof.</hi> Now the Sea has a prevailing Power; therefore the Sea ſpoken of in
<hi>Revelations,</hi> which ſhall be no more, is, that the wicked ſhall then have no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Power. For altho the Devil does ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, after the thouſand Years, his <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> yet it will be to their utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And the Lord ſpenking in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
57.20,21. of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Peace and Healing, and of the Wicked Worlds Deſtruction, as in the 20. v. <hi>But the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. There
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45720:169"/>is no Peace, ſaith my God, to the Wicked.</hi> Here the wicked are ſaid, in the day of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to be like the troubled Sea. And at the time when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be delivered from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of all his Enemies, it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.22. <hi>The Lord ſaith, I will bring again from</hi> Baſham, <hi>I will bring my People again from the depths of the Sea.</hi> Here we ſee that the wicked are the depths of the Sea; from which God will bring his People from under their Power. And the wicked as a Sea ſhall never more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. And it is ſaid,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 33.23,24. <hi>Thy tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are loſed, they could not well ſtrengthen their Maſt, they could not ſpread the Sail. Then is the Prey of a great ſpoil divided, the lame take the prey. The Inhabitants ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity.</hi> When the Lord comes, then the wicked can neither ſpread their Sail, nor ſtrengthen their Maſt. Then will the prey of a great ſpoil be divided, then will the lame take the prey. That is, the Afflicted People of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> And at that time the Inhabitants ſhall not ſay, I am ſick.</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2,3,4.
<hi>And I</hi> John <hi>ſaw the Holy City, New</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>coming down from God out of Heaven, prepared, as a Bride adorned for her Husband. And I heard a great Voice out of Heaven, ſaying, behold the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his People, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God. And God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, and<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45720:169"/>there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither ſhall there be any more pain, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer things are paſt away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my God; and he ſhall go no more out; and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is the New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my New Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord, as well as St. <hi>John,</hi> ſaith, the
<hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> comes down out of Heaven from God. Now as to what this City is, that comes down out of Heaven from God, it does plainly appear to be the whole Church triumphant; for St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, it is this City, the <hi>New Jerdſalem,</hi> which he ſaw prepared as a Bride adorned for her Husband. Then it cannot be any outward glorious Fabrick which the Lord is ſaid to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe, or is fit to be the Lamb's Wife. But the Lord has promiſed to eſpouſe his Church to himſelf at the great Wedding-Supper. For as yet the Souls are ſaid to be under the Altar; and therefore not yet made Partakers of the Glory that ſhall be revealed. But at the Laſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, when the Dead ſhall be raiſed incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Bodies of the Saints again to them re-united, and thoſe that have been the Lord's Witneſſes, mentioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> with them caught up in the Clouds to meet the Lord in Air. And then as it is ſaid; God ſhall wipe away all tears from their Eyes, and then<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45720:170"/>there ſhall be with them no more Death, neither ſorrow, nor crying. And by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed new Covenant <hi>Iſrael</hi> will then fall little ſhort of this, when the Lord hath taken away their ſins, and ſo ſecured them in himſelf, as they ſhall never more ſin againſt him. For altho afterward thay ſhall know a temporal Death. Yet the Lord in <hi>John</hi> 11.26. <hi>John</hi> 6.50.
<hi>Terms that not a dying. And</hi> Revelations 19.11. It is there declared how the Lord ſhall come. For St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And St. <hi>John</hi> in the 14 Chap. 14. <hi>v.</hi> Doth open to us, what theſe white horſes are. For he there ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14. <hi>He beheld a white Cloud, and upon the Cloud one ſat like unto the Son of Man, having on his head a Golden Crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſickle.</hi> You ſee here that the white horſes are white Clouds, and that the Lord will come in the Clouds of Heaven, as was declared by the Angels, in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. <hi>And the Lord alſo told his Diſciples,</hi> John 14.2. <hi>In my fathers houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo I would have told you, I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you.</hi> 3. <hi>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45720:170"/>unto my ſelf.</hi> Now without doubt in the Clouds, there will be Receptacles of Glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the Lord and his chief raiſed Saints and Angels. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 21.9. <hi>There came unto him an Angel and talked with him, Saying, come up hither, and I will ſhew the bride the lambs wife.</hi> 10.

But it is certain that it will come down out of Heaven. And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt Glorious Kingdom in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.33,34,35. <hi>To him that rideth upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of Heavens, which were of old, Lo, He doth ſend forth his voice, and that a mighty voice.</hi> 34. <hi>Aſcribe the ſtrength unto our God, his excellency is over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and his ſtrength is in the Clouds.</hi>
35. <hi>O God, thou art terrible out of thy Holy places.

The which is plain, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more comprehended in it, than we have hitherto apprehended. The which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth fully make appear in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4,5,6. <hi>When the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Sion, <hi>and ſhall have purged the Blood of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <hi>from the midſt thereof, by the Spirit of Judgment, and by the Spirit of burning. And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and upon all her Aſſembles a Cloud, and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming Fire by night, for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence. And there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day time from the Heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a Covert from the Storm, and from the Rain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt of theſe Verſes, the Prophet tells us, when this Glory ſhall be Revealed, which will be at the time when the Lord ſhall have waſhed away the filth of the Daughter of <hi>Sion</hi> by the Spirit of Judgment, and by the Spirit of burning. This appears to be the Baptiſm St.
<hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, where he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11,12. <hi>He that cometh after me, is mightier than I whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall baptiſe you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire. Whoſe fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and gather his Wheat into his Garner, but he will burn up the Chaff with unqueuchable Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is ſaid that Chriſt Baptiſed none; but after his Aſcenſion, the Diſciples were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with the Holy Ghoſt: But then Chriſt did not gather his Wheat into his Garner, neither
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45720:171"/>then did he burn up the Chaff with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fire; therefore this has a more ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Lords ſecond coming, at which time he will throughly purge his Floor, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Wheat into his Garner; and then it is that he will burn up the Chaff with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fire. And whereas the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5,6. <hi>That the Lord will Create upon every dwelling place of Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and upon all her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, a cloud and ſmoke by day, and the ſhining of a flaming Fire by Night.</hi> Theſe words does not only take in the dwelling Places of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> but all her Aſſemblies, the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> whoſe Dominions, accoring Scripture, is larger than whatever they have yet had in poſſeſſion, over which this glorious cloud here ſpoken of will be extended; which does fully appear to be the Tabernacle ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Which the Lord ſhall pitch, and not man.</hi> According to which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in the 6. v.
<hi>And there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day time from the Heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from the Storm and from the Rain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Cloud that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of, being like unto flaming Fire, and I cannot conceive that there could be a more fit reſemblance, than Gold that is like to clear Glaſs, to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of flaming Fire. And it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.18. <hi>The City was pure Gold, like unto clear Glaſs. And in the</hi> 21. v. <hi>And the Street of the City was pure Gold, as it were tranſparent Glaſs.</hi> Now
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45720:172"/>
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in the 4. c. at the 6. v.
<hi>That the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle ſhould be a ſhadow from the Heat, and a place of Refuge and a Covert from the Storm, and from the Rain;</hi> Under which the Elect will be ſecured from the Judgments that will be poured upon the Earth after the Lord comes.</p>
                  <p>Here you ſee in this, <hi>Rev</hi> 21. he ſaith that the Street of the City was pure Gold, like to Tranſparent Glaſs. And here by this one ſtreet he comprehends the Pavement of the whole City; the which being over the Heads of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> will appear, though of the Colour of Gold, yet it is ſaid to be ſo clear, as to look like Tranſparent Glaſs, ſo that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> underneath this Tabernacle, may all ſee the Glory that is there Revealed. And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the City that St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of in the 21 c.
2. v. He therein comprehends the raiſed Saints; but herein the ſame chap. at the 18. and 21. v. he there ſpeaks of the outward fabrick, or glorious Manſion; for in Scripture the People are termed a City, as well as a material Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo termed. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, in the forementioned Chapter, after he had related the coming down of the City; He then ſpeaks of the Glory of the ſame, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.11. <hi>Having the glory of God, and her light was like a ſtone, moſt precious, even like a Jaſper, clear as Criſtal;</hi> 12. <hi>And had a Wall great and high, and had twelve Gates, and at the Gates twelve Angels, and names<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45720:172"/>written thereon, which are the Names of the twelve Tribes of the Children of</hi> Iſrael. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, c. 21. 15. v. <hi>And he that talked with me, had a Golden Reed to meaſure the City, and the gates thereof, and the Wall thereof.</hi> 16. <hi>And the City lieth four ſquare, and the length is as large as the breadth, and he meaſured the City with the Reed, twelve thouſand furlongs, the length, and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we ſee by the large extent of this City, which according to account of eight furlongs to a Mile, to be fifteen hundred Miles; not only in length, but that the breadth and heighth thereof are equal; this being the Tabernacle which the Lord ſhall pitch, and not Man; and then will the Lord make good his Promiſe to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that there ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day time, from the heat, and for a place of Refuge, and for a covert from the ſtorm and from the rain. And in
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.1.2. <hi>Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee. For behold, darkneſs ſhall cover the Earth, and groſs darkneſs the People, but the Lord ſhall riſe upon thee, and his Glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee.</hi> For as the Lord is ſaid in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.14. to be over
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in a Cloudy Pillar, when he delivered them out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> which was but a Figure of the great deliverance to come, at which time the Lord will be in the Clouds, and his Spouſe, his chief raiſed Saints with him. This Tabernacle, Covert or City, is ſaid to be twelve thouſand<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45720:173"/>furlongs, not only in length and breadth, but the ſame in heighth, by which it does appear, that the top thereof may reach to Heaven, and that the Heavens may remain open above it, as it was when it deſcended, until this Glory that ſhall be Revealed, be drawn up again, and that the Throne of God, in the higheſt Heavens, may be placed over <hi>Mount Sion:</hi> That as it is ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. <hi>That the Ladder which</hi> Jacob <hi>ſaw ſet upon the Earth, the top of which reached to Heaven, and that the Angels of God did aſcend and deſcend upon it, and the Lord God ſtood above it:</hi> By which it doth appear that this Ladder will prove the white Clouds, and that the Top of them will reach to Heaven, whilſt one part of them may extend ſo low as <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and theſe appear to be the Ladder upon which the Angels aſcended and deſcended upon the Son of Man, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 1.51. <hi>Hereafter ye ſhall ſee Heaven open, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of Man.</hi> The which words of the Lord, in ſaying, that you ſhall ſee the Heavens open, doth ſeem to ſignify the continuance of their remaining open for ſome time. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 22. <hi>He ſaw no Temple in this City, which came down from Heaven, for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it.</hi> 23. <hi>And the City had no need of the Son, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it, for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the lamb is the Light thereof.</hi> Now, if the Heavens be open over this City, and the Throne of God<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45720:173"/>juſt above it, as it is ſaid of the Ladder, God ſtood at the top of it, then muſt the Glory of God inlighten this City, as well as the Lamb is the light thereof. And according to all theſe places of Scripture it doth ſo appear to be, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it properly be ſaid, that there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Glory between the Father and the Son, for Chriſt ſaith to the Father in
<hi>John</hi> 17.5. <hi>Glorify thou me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where the Glory of the Son is, there is the Glory of the Father alſo. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of the Angel, ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. <hi>He ſhewed me a pure River of water of Life, clear as Cryſtal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb.</hi> Now we read nothing of the Holy Ghoſt, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, This River proceeded out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, and it is ſaid of the Spirit to proceed from the Father and the Son; and the Lord termeth the Holy Spirit to Water, in <hi>John</hi> 4.14.
<hi>But whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thirſt, but the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of Water, ſpringing up into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</hi> And the Lord farther ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 7.38. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of Living Water.</hi> 39. <hi>But this ſpake the Lord of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. God ſaith,
<hi>I will pour Water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground, I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my bleſſing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45720:174"/>upon thy Off-ſpring.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4.
<hi>There is a River, the ſtreams thereof ſhall make glad the City of the most High.</hi> Therefore this River here ſpoken of, the which proceedeth from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, muſt be meant of the Spirit. And it is ſaid of this Heavenly City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. <hi>There ſhall be no more Curſe, but the Throne of God and of the Lamb ſhall be in it.</hi> 4.
<hi>And they ſhall ſee his Face, and his Name ſhall be in their foreheads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words ſhew that the Saints will always be about the Throne, both in the time that is to come, and alſo in Eternity. And to what
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith in the 60. c. which treats of the Heavenly
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and alſo of the new Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one. For it is there ſaid, the Lord ſhall riſe upon thee. 3. v. <hi>And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing.</hi> By which it does appear, that the Gentiles and Kings, that is, as many of them as have had an intereſt in Chriſt, and are departed this World, ſhall come to the brightneſs of their Riſing or Glory; the which is in the
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which comes down from Heaven. And from the 4. v. of the ſame Chap. to the 18. it treats of them that are to be call'd in with the Jews, at the ſecond coming of the Lord. But it is ſaid, 9. v. <hi>Surely the Iſles ſhall wait for me.</hi> Now this waiting could not be at Chriſt's firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for then the Iſles had no knowledg of the Lord, and therefore could not be ſaid to wait for him they knew not. And in the 19. and<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45720:174"/>20. verſes of this 60. chap. ſpeaking of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The Sun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſs ſhall the Moon give light unto thee, but the Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting light, and thy God the Glory.</hi> 20. <hi>Thy Son ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy Moon withdraw it ſelf, for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light, and the days of thy mourning ſhall be ended.</hi> And in the 21. v. it ſpeaks of the People of <hi>Iſrael: Thy People ſhall be all righteous, they ſhall inherit the Land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</hi> 22. v. <hi>A little one ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong Nation, I the Lord will haſten it in his time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Prophet ſpeaks of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who in a more peculiar manner belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this City, that they ſhould be all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and that they ſhall Inherit the Land for ever; and that they ſhould multiply therein and increaſe, and that this ſhould be in its time, which will be at the Reſtitution of all things; and then will there be a new Earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> built upon her own heap, as <hi>Jer.</hi>
30.18. And then as the Lord ſath <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.12. <hi>I will make thy windows of Agates, and thy Gates of Carbuncles, and all thy Borders of pleaſant Stones:</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, <hi>Tobit</hi> ſaith, 13. c. 15. v. <hi>Let my Soul bleſs God the great King.</hi> 16. <hi>For</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>ſhall be built up with Saphires, and Emeralds, and Precious Stones, thy Walls and Towers and Battlements, with pure Gold.</hi> 17. <hi>And the ſtreets<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45720:175"/>of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be Paved with Beril, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huucle, and Stones of Ophir.</hi> 18. <hi>And all her ſtreets ſhall ſay, Alleluja, and they ſhall praiſe him, ſaying, bleſſed be God which hath extolled it for ever.</hi> Now in this Earthly
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> there is ſaid to be a Temple, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1. Where the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſaid to come from under the Threſhold. Now when the Lord cometh to Judg the world and to deliver <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then will his Elect be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to the Holy Land: And it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.19.
<hi>When it ſhall hail, coming down on the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, the City ſhall be low in a low place.</hi> Here the People is term'd the City, according to that in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.12. where <hi>Iſrael</hi> is treated, <hi>A City ſought out and not forſaken.</hi> This Hail is the horrible Tempeſt ſpoken of,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt ſhall be the portion of their Cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now altho the Wicked are for ſome time left upon the Earth after the Lord comes, to receive the Puniſhments the Lord has appointed them upon the Earth, and to behold the Glory of the Saints, as it is ſaid,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.10. <hi>The wicked ſhall ſee it, and be grieved, he ſhall gnaſh with his Teeth, and melt away, the deſire of the wicked ſhall periſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, after the Wicked have received part of their Puniſhment here, this forementioned hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Tempeſt will ſweep away all the refuge of Lies; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.17. and in the 29. c. 20,21. v. It is ſaid, <hi>The terrible one is brought to nought, and the Scorner is conſumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off. That make a man a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:45720:175"/>offender for a word, and lay a ſnare for him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth in the Gate, and turn aſide the juſt for a thing of naught.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1.
<hi>For behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an Oven, all the proud, yea, and all that do wicked ſhall he ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, and it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> 2. <hi>But unto them that fear my Name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Wings, and ye ſhall go forth, and grow up as Calves of the ſtall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the time of the utter Deſtruction, as I have ſhow'd you, then will the City be low in a low place, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.19.
<hi>When it ſhall Hail, coming down on the Forreſt, and the City ſhall be low in a low place.</hi> Which City is the People, as I have elſewhere proved to you.</p>
                  <p>Now where this place will be, the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> tells us, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Then ſhall the Lord go forth and Fight againſt thoſe Nations, as when he fought in the day of Battle.</hi> 4.
<hi>And his Feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the Mount of</hi> Olives,
<hi>which is before</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>on the Eaſt, and the Mount of</hi> Olives <hi>ſhall cleave in the midſt thereof, towards the Eaſt, and toward the Weſt, and there ſhall be a very great Valley, and half of the Mountain ſhall remove toward the North, and half toward the South.</hi> 5.
<hi>And ye ſhall flee to the Valley of the Mountains, for the Valley of the Mountains ſhall reach unto</hi> Azal.</p>
                  <p>Now here by theſe words it doth evidently appear, that
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> with the reſt of the Promiſed Elect, that will be called in at the coming of<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45720:176"/>the Lord, which then alſo will be gathered to the Holy Land, and ſecured from the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that will fall on the wicked, before the ſweeping Tempeſt cometh that carrieth them all away. For when the Lord deſcends ſo far down, as his Feet to ſtand on <hi>Monnt Olivet,</hi> the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then cleaves aſunder, and then it is, they fly into the Valley of the mountain. For as <hi>Noah</hi> was ſecured in the Ark, when the world was deſtroyed by the Flood: So it doth appear that the Elect will be ſecured in this Valley, whilſt the World is deſtroyed by the horrible tempeſt of Hail, Fire, and Brimſtone; then, as it is ſaid, the City ſhall be low in a low place. And as concerning the Deſtruction of this World, <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Eſd.</hi> 7.29,30,31. <hi>The World ſhall be turned into the old ſilence ſeven days, like as in the former Judgment, ſo that no man ſhall remain. And after ſeven days, the World that yet awaketh not, ſhall be raiſed up, and that ſhall die that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid that the world ſhall be turn'd into ſilence ſeven days, like as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Judgments, by which it doth appear, that as by the former judgments of the Rains from Heaven, and with the Fountains of the great Deep, being broken up from beneath, by which the old World became ſilent; and at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this World, by the words it doth appear, that this will remain ſilent for ſeven days, as the old World did for many more; for the Waters did continue upon the Earth for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45720:176"/>ſome conſiderable time. Now, whereas it is ſaid that no man ſhould remain; the which words may be taken in a twofold ſence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That no man of this wicked World ſhall remain.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, That the Elect fleeing into <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> may there ſleep, whilſt the Earth is deſtroyed, and again renewed to that perfection, as it was in the firſt Creation, and
<hi>Canaan</hi> made like to <hi>Eden</hi> the Garden of God. And after the world has lain waſt, God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it by the Eighth; and our Sabbath being on the eighth day, it doth thereby ſeem to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy as much; and the bleſſing was not given to the name of the Seventh day, but to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath Day. And altho thoſe that are choſen for the Glorious Tabernacle, are ſaid to be changed in the twinkling of an Eye, and ſo caught up in the Clouds; but <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the other Elect have no ſuch ſudden Change; and therefore it doth likely appear theſe may have their Earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Bodies Renewed at that time, as the Earth is, and their heart ſo changed, as it is ſaid in <hi>Eſdras,</hi> to another meaning; the which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of the Lord, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. <hi>And he that ſate upon the Throne, ſaid, behold I make all things new; and he ſaid unto me, write, for theſe words are true and faithful.</hi> Here we ſee that the Lord will make all things New: Now as ſome of the Chapters in
<hi>Revelations</hi> are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed; So ſome of the Verſes of this Chapter in <hi>Eſdras</hi> do certainly appear to be miſplaced,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45720:177"/>becauſe the World is ſaid to be deſtroyed, and the Dead Raiſed, before the moſt high is ſaid to ſit upon the Throne of Judgment. Now after this World is thus Renewed, and Reſtored, and
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> again Built, then as it is ſaid in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.11.
<hi>And men ſhall dwell in it, and there ſhall be no more utter destruction, but</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſhall be ſafely inhabited.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in that the Lord ſaith, there will be no more utter deſtruction there, whereby it doth appear, that there will be ſome deſtroy'd, but not an utter Deſtruction, for after the thouſand years the
<hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magag</hi> will come up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which company will be all deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>I have given a more full Account of this <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> where I have ſpoken of the very, or ſpecial Elect, and therefore ſhall not here further enlarge upon it.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Prophecy of</hi> Luther<hi>'s which is wonderfully remarkable; and alſo it is worded according to the Scripture Stile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ther</hi> began to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to fall off from the Pope in the year 1515, and he Lived and Preached till
1546. and in the time of his Preaching (the year is not ſet down) he did aſſure them, before two hundred<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45720:177"/>years be expired (if not ſooner by the coming of the dreadful day of Judgment, they be conſumed) that all their abominable Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Idolatries, and damnable Religion, will utterly be extirminated and deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>And on the contrary, we (who for the ſake of profeſſing God's Holy word in truth, are tormented, terrified, baniſhed, impriſoned and ſlain here on Earth by that man of Sin and God's Enemies, the Antichriſt and Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>) at the laſt day with unſpeakable comfort, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and take poſſeſſion of the Fruits of our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured hopes, namely, everlaſting Conſolation Joy and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſaying of</hi> Luther's <hi>was before the former, by reaſon he mentions that the Goſpel was not at that time Preached in</hi> England, <hi>when he ſpake this as followeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ah, Loving God (ſaid <hi>Luther</hi>) come once; I wait continually for that day, when Early in the morning (in the Spring, the day and the night are alike long) I ſee a very clear Morning Red. For theſe are my Cogitations (whereof I purpoſe alſo to Preach) that ſwiftly out of the morning red, will come a black thick Cloud, out of which will iſſue three flakes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; afterwards there will come a clap, and in a moment will ſtrike all on a heap, Heaven and Earth. The Name of the Lord be praiſed who hath taught us to ſigh and yearn after that day,<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45720:178"/>indeed we ought to deſire the ſpeedy approach thereof.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Turk</hi> (ſaid <hi>Luther</hi>) begineth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to decline, then certainly the laſt day will come; for then it muſt needs be, of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scripture, the loving Lord will come, as the Scripture ſaith; and when I come, I will move Heaven and Earth, and then ſhall come the deſire of all Nations.</p>
                  <p>At the laſt there will be great Alteration and Commotion, for then all the Elements ſhall be melted to Aſhes, the whole World ſhall be made a vaſt lump again, as in the Begining; then there ſhall be a New Heaven and Earth, and we ſhall be changed; but the Devil ſhall remain as he is, for he hath nothing of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, who had great Revelations. But I hope, ſeeing the Goſpel in ſuch ſort is contemned, that the laſt day is not far, two hundred years hence God's word will decreaſe again and fall, and there will be a great darkneſs, for want of upright, faithful Servants of the Word, as then the whole World will be wild and Epicuriſh, and then the Voice will come and ſound, behold the Bridegroom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, ſtrike all on an heap, Heaven and Earth: Here he ſpeaketh in the Scripture way of ſpeaking, terming the Powers and People, to the Heavens and Earth, for a great State of Power and People, is term'd Heavens and an Earth, as I have before ſhow'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45720:178"/>you in ſeveral places: As the old <hi>Babilon</hi> was ſo termed, when at the Deſtruction thereof, it was ſaid that the Heavens and earth were removed out of their places; and this <hi>Romiſh</hi> Babiloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Power, is alſo by the word, ſaid to be the Heavens and Earth. And here he ſays they are to be ſtruck on an Heap: That is, thrown down, like an heap of Rubbiſh, without any diſtinction of their Honour and Dignity, till the Judgment of the Lord deſtroys them all; and in that he terms it the laſt day, his meaning is the laſt day of the Power of this World.</p>
                  <p>And as to the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Luther</hi> hath given us for a certain ſign the <hi>Turks</hi> declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the which is already come to paſs, and then it is, he ſaith, will be the laſt day, of the Power of this wicked World; for then Chriſt will come: But when all the wicked are to be deſtroyed from off the Earth, then he ſaith, there will be great Alterations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, ſo as the Elements will be burnt to Aſhes; and then will the Earth of People, with the material Earth, lye as a vaſt lump again, as in the begining, as in <hi>Eſdras</hi> it is ſaid, Seven days; and then the renewed Heavens and Earth will appear more Glorious, for then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth will be renewed to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as 'twas in the firſt Creation; then ſhall ſome that ſleep in the duſt awake, as its ſaid in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> for all that are raiſed, do not Riſe to the Glorious Tabernacle; of whom <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, they ſhall ſleep<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45720:179"/>in the Woods, which is like unto that of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice. Now the Elements that are here ſaid to be burnt to Aſhes, are the Elements of Mans Body, and this by his own way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of it, is made clearly Evident, in that he ſaith, the Devil ſhall remain as he is, becauſe he hath nothing of the Elements in him. Theſe forementioned Elements, are the Elements St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, which ſhall melt with fervent Heat: And of whom the Pſalmiſt ſaith, They ſhall melt as the Fat of Lambs, even with ſmoke ſhall they conſume away. But as for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Heavens, Air, Sea and Earth, in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of which is incloſed Hell: And for us to think that theſe ſhall be burnt to Aſhes, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together repugnant to Scripture; for God hath ſet the Sun, as I have already proved, as a faithful Witneſs in Heaven; and when the Devil is at laſt caſt into Hell, it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. he was confined there, day and night, for ever and for ever. And alſo it is ſaid of the Wiſe, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever and for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it was Propheſied of <hi>Luther,</hi> by Holy Men: As firſt, a Learned Frier, at <hi>Eiſenach,</hi> named <hi>John Hilten,</hi> who Propheſied, touching <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, namely, That about the year
1516, Popedom would greatly decline, as God be praiſed, was through
<hi>Luther</hi> fulfilled; and eſpecially concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> and touching his<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45720:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>Powerful Teaching and Preaching,
<hi>John Huſs</hi> Propheſied in the year 1415, as he was to be burned at
<hi>Coſtnitz,</hi> who ſaid, This day ye Roſt a Gooſe, but one hundred years hence, ye ſhall hear a Swan Sing, (<hi>Huſs</hi> is called a
<hi>Gooſe,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> a <hi>Swan</hi>) him ye ſhall not be able to Roſt, nor overcome; which Gloriouſly was made true on
<hi>Luther;</hi> for in the year 1515, he began to ſing, and ſo Powerfully Preached, and Wrought, and Fought, as ſince the Apoſtles times, none hath done the like; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in deſpight of the Papiſts (whom vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in open fight he Encountred) he lived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years afterwards; and in the year 1546, departed in Peace on his bed.</p>
                  <p>Now in that God terms the Wicked to the Heavens and Earth, and the World, thereby he leaves man ſcope to come to Repentance, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſo does, they are then neither termed the Heavens nor the Earth, nor World that is here ſpoken of, that is to be deſtroyed;

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45720:180"/>years; in which Time thoſe who were the chief Mourners were remov'd by Death; and ſo now if we, by the freſh breaking forth of the clear light of the Goſpel, with the Voice of the Bridegroom's coming, we ſo awake, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, we ſhall have as good ſucceſs as
<hi>Nineveh</hi> had, for thereby the Earth of the Wicked will be decreaſed, and the Servants of Chriſt increaſed.</p>
                  <p>And in that <hi>Luther</hi> doth ſay, There ſhall be a Voice of the Bridegroom's coming, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Angel ſaid to
<hi>Daniel,</hi> altho not in the ſame words, but to the ſame effect, as in
<hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. <hi>But thou, O</hi> Daniel, <hi>ſhut up the words, and ſeal the Book, even to the time of the end; many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledg ſhall be-increaſed.</hi> This fully ſhows that knowledg ſhall be increaſed at the time of the end, which end is now juſt approaching, and knowledge breaking forth at the Coming of the Lord, thereby to make preparation for his coming; But my Soul is troubled when I think of the Words of the Lord; concerning the willful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the Chriſtians, after they have No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his Coming; for he ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. <hi>He ſent his Servants at Supper-time, to ſay to them which were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready.</hi> 18. v. <hi>And they all with one accord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make excuſe,</hi> being eager after the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this World. Here we ſee theſe might have came, had they not been wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for which the Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt them. And here we ſee by the<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45720:181"/>Lord, as well as by <hi>Daniel</hi> and
<hi>Luther,</hi> that there would be notice given at the end of the time, of his Coming; of which the Lord ſaith is juſt at Supper-time. And the Lord alſo ſaid Dan. 12.9,10. <hi>And he ſaid, go thy way,</hi> Daniel, <hi>for the words are cloſed up and ſealed till the time of the end;</hi> Which plainly ſhews there was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in it which was not to be revealed till now the end of the time. And alſo the Lord ſaith in the tenth verſe, <hi>Many ſhall be purified and made white, and tried; but the wicked ſhall do wickedly: and none of the wicked ſhall underſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand.</hi> And whereas it is ſaid, none of the wicked ſhall underſtand; that is, thoſe that have given themſelves to work ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſhall be left of God to hardneſs of heart and blindneſs of mind. And whereas it is ſaid, the Wiſe ſhall underſtand, it is meant by them that truly fear the Lord, for the fear of the Lord is ſaid to be the beginning of Wiſdom; and theſe are thoſe that ſhall not be in darkneſs at that day; but that the ſigns, with the opened revealed Will of God in his Word, ſhall now alarm them to prepare for his coming. Now between theſe there is a third ſort, which by the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Warning, they might have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of making preparation. For the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ſet upon the Watch-Tower to warn all: And if the Wicked Man die without Warning, although he die in his iniquity, yet his Blood will God require at the Watchmans hand, according to the Word of the Lord in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.6,7,8,<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45720:181"/>14,15.
<hi>But if the Watchman ſee the ſword come, and blow not the Trumpet, and the people be not warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the Sword come, and take any perſon from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the Watchmans hand.</hi> 7. <hi>So thou, O Son of Man, I have ſet thee a Watchman unto the Houſe of Iſrael: therefore thou ſhalt hear the Word at my mouth, and warn them from me.</hi> 8. <hi>When I ſay unto the Wicked, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely die, if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the Wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> For the Lord ſaith in the 14th verſe, <hi>When I ſay to the Wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely die, if he turn from his ſin, and do that which is lawful and right,</hi> 15. v. <hi>he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this we alſo ſee, that if God doth ſay to the Wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely die, yet that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was of force, no longer than the man remained ſinful. But as for thoſe ſinners, who by their continual cuſtom in ſin, God has left to hardneſs of heart, and blindneſs of mind, they cannot come to amendment of Life. And God ſaith, according to this, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the Righteous, that he ſhall ſurely live; if he truſt to his own Righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, all his Righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembered: but for his iniquity that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he ſhall die for it.</hi> According to this is the Words of Chriſt, in the Goſpel, where he ſaith, He that believeth in me ſhall be ſaved; the which Words includes no longer than they<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45720:182"/>ſo continue believing; which belief muſt be a practical belief; the which is, to believe in Chriſt and his Word, ſo as to live in Obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for it is ſaid, Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord. And between Holineſs and Righteouſneſs it is hard to make a diſtinction: But as to what the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. was ſpoken for the time to come, when God ſhall have committed all Judgment to the Son, for which time this was ſpoken; that is, thoſe that then ſhall be found believers, are then paſſed from Death to Life, ſo as they ſhall never come into condemnation. And as for the Sheep, that ſo ſecurely ſtand, of whom Chriſt ſaith, none can pluck them out of my Fathers Hand, is ſpoken of thoſe that are Chriſts ſtanding Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes thorough the World; they being thoſe very Elect of whom Chriſt ſaid, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to deceive; and of whom it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> they follow the Lamb whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he goeth. This being clearly proved where I have ſpoken of the very Elect, I do but here mention it, that thereby we may know, that we do not ſo ſecurely ſtand; but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Hebrews,</hi> We, like
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> having a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of entering into life, ſhould take heed leſt any of us ſhould ſall ſhort of entering into that promiſed Reſt; therefore he adviſes us to make our Calling and Election ſure; and Chriſt alſo invites ſinners to come to Repentance; and if we are not wanting to our ſelves, Chriſt will not be wanting to us; And by the Watchmans<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45720:182"/>Warning, there may be great part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaved from the near approaching danger, by what God ſaith in
<hi>Ezekiel;</hi> for there is but few Soldiers, but when they have the warning given them, but they will ſeek to deliver themſelves; and God ſaith in
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.5. <hi>He that taketh warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall deliver his Soul.</hi> Methinks this promiſe ſhould make us with life and vigour laborious to gain life for our ſouls, ſo as we may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the near approaching danger; for that we are in the time in which the Lord will come is certain. The which time will be, according to that of the Children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> with ſigns and wonders; the which we have ſeen what the Lord foretold ſhould be before his coming.</p>
                  <p>And now with the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſion made good to us, ſo that knowledg ſhall be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unſealing of the Book, at the now time of the end; the which will occaſion great running to and fro, ſo as knowledg may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, to prepare for the coming of the Lord, according to which, the Lord ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. <hi>That he ſent forth his Servants at ſupper time, to ſay to them that are bidden, come, for all things are now ready.</hi> The which gives us alſo certain information that Light ſhould break forth, as thereby warning ſhould be given for preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made for the coming of the Lord to Judg the World, and give rewards to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; the Old World had by <hi>Noah,</hi> warning given them, whom the Scripture terms, a Preacher of Righteouſneſs; but becauſe they<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45720:183"/>would not believe and amend, therefore they were deſtroyed. And the Lord ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.6. <hi>At midnight there was a cry made, behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.</hi> Which ſhows in midſt of the Night of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to the coming of the Lord, that light will break forth, ſo as the cry of the Voice of his Miniſters may be heard, to warn the People for to prepare to meet the Bridegroom; yet upon the Wicked unbelieving World it will come as a Thief in the Night: And alſo, as to the Day and Hour, no man knoweth. Now whereas God ſaith in <hi>Iſaiah, That that day ſhall come as a ſnare upon all fleſh.</hi> Yet as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, the word, all, in Scripture, doth not ſignify the whole, but the major part. Now as to what is faid in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. <hi>And I ſaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel flying in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting Goſpel to Preach unto them that dwell on the Earth, to every Nation, Tongue and People.</hi> 7. <hi>Saying with a loud voice, fear God, give glory to him, for the hour of his Judgment is come, and worſhip him that made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and the Fountains of Water.</hi> This appears to be after the Lord comes in the Clouds with his Saints and Angels; and that as the Chriſtians that were before bidden, and ſent to by his Servants at Supper time, to come to his Supper; So it doth appear, that thoſe that knew him not, may afterwards be invited by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, by which means <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Promiſed Elect, may be brought in. For <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45720:183"/>firſt Preached Chriſt to the Jews, before he was made publick to the World: Afterwards when he was made publick, the Lord ſent his Diſciples to Preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles. Now this being moſt agreeable to the word, and what I apprehend
'twill be; but however, the Miniſters may preſs forward for a publication of the Goſpel every where; but if they find not bleſſed ſucceſs, to forbear, and to beſtow their Labour amongſt the Chriſtians and Turks, and ſuch as have the Knowledg of God, who muſt ſtand or fall, as their Maſter finds them; but as for the Jews and promiſed Elect, if they come not in, they will be ſure to be received into Mercy after the Lord comes, as many as have not eſtranged themſelves from God, by wicked Practices.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.11. <hi>And from the time the daily Sacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the Abomination that maketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate ſet up, there ſhould be a thouſand, two hundred and ninety days.</hi> And in the following Verſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thouſand, three hundred and five and thirty days.</hi> Here is 45 days of years difference, between this and the forementioned number; And it is ſaid that he is bleſſed that waiteth, and cometh to the laſt Number of the Thouſand, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and five and thirty days. Now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exact number of years <hi>Iſrael</hi> knew, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> before they had Conquered their Enemies, ſo as to be<pb n="168" facs="tcp:45720:184"/>ſettled in the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> for they lay forty years in the Wilderneſs, and five years they were Conquering their Enemies, before they peaceably ſettled in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Now the like time being mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth appear, from the time of the viſible ſigns of the Lord's Coming, till the time he comes, and alſo until the time that all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are cut of, doth ſeem to be the exact num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years, becauſe the Lord ſaith, he that waiteth and cometh to the five and forty days of years, beyond the forementioned Number, are ſaid to be bleſſed, which Argues, by that time, all the wicked will be cut off from the Face of the Earth; for he that liveth to that time being bleſſed, ſignifies that there will be none living but what will then be bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>And that we may be made partakers of this bleſſedneſs, here is a ſhort Account of the Faith we are to believe. For Faith in Chriſt is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is become the Author of Eternal Salvation, to all them that obey him: And thoſe that would be made partakers of this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, muſt go to God, by daily and ſervent Prayer, and imploy their Diligence in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.20,22. <hi>For Faith without works is Dead, and by works is Faith made perfect. And without Holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Heb. 12.14.</p>
                  <p>And in Epheſ. 2.3. to the 10. v. <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, Created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45720:184"/>works, which God hath before Ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> It is of the great mercy and rich Grace of God, in that he gave the Son his Love, a ranſome to make ſatisfaction, and Reconciliation for as many as ſhall come unto God by him; and therefore it is of Grace that any is ſaved; and we no ſooner Repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if done in ſincerity, but we are excepted of Chriſt, and then his Righteouſneſs and good Works is imputed to us, as though we had been Created ſo; Notwithſtanding we had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, great ſinners. But after we are received into Mercy, God hath fore-ordain'd that we ſhould walk in good Works, which if we will not, we ſhall have neither part nor lot in this Portion; and the Apoſtle ſaith, It is of Faith that worketh by Love is required, and there is no ſuch obedience as that, in which the Heart is concern'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to believe in Chriſt for Salvation is to believe his word for it, and if we believe his word for it, we believe that Salvation is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able according to his Word; the which we no ſooner believe, but weare by his word put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Vineyard to work therein; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Race that we are to run, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is prepared for us to put on, in which we are to maintain a continual Combat with the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lives end, we muſt continue in, and hold out, and overcome, if we ever intend to<pb n="170" facs="tcp:45720:185"/>have the Crown: For altho ſome of theſe Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may get the Advantage at ſome time, yet beſure keep ſo good a guard, that when you find any breaking in of the Enemy, go to the Lord with Submiſſion, Contrition, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, begging new Strength from him, that you may be able to Conquer theſe your Enemies, and that you may have grace of him, ſo to withſtand them, as they may not break in upon you.</p>
                  <p>And as for our ſaying that God is merciful, and we truſt in God, yet walk according to our own imaginations, and fancies, is but to truſt God to deſtroy us; for although God is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Merciful, yet his Mercies will be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted according as he hath declared in his word.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.
<hi>Strive to enter in at the ſteight Gate, for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> This hath a ſpecial reference to the time of the Lord's Coming to Judg the World; but what reference it hath to the preſent time, is to thoſe that either ſtrive in a falſe way, or elſe go out in their own ſtrength, with a reſolution to ſerve the Lord, and amend their Lives: When withal they ſhould go to God to beg ſtrength of him, to fulfil theſe their Reſolutions, and alſo for his continual Aſſiſtance in this their Pilgrimage, and if ſo, he hath ſaid, he will never leave us nor forſake us; for if we do not ſo, in Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Afflictions, we ſhall fall away; for the beſt of men are not able, in their own ſtrength,<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45720:185"/>to grapple with the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. And for our Example, St. <hi>Peter</hi> putting too much confidence in himſelf, therefore ſo fouly fell, as to deny his Maſter; and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have ſome of us known thoſe that have made Vows and Proteſtations for their amendment; but putting confidence in themſelves, thinking they had Power to perform it, without ſeeking to God for his continual aſſiſtance, in their performance of theſe their Reſolutions; and for want of ſo doing, how ſoon hath all theſe Vows and Proteſtations been Vanquiſht? But if we take to the means, and go in the way, then unto them the Lord ſaith, <hi>He that asketh, receiveth, and he that ſeeketh, findeth, and unto him that knocketh it ſhall be opened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> That is, after they were called, ſo as to be brought into the knowledg of the Truth, which afterwards, they not imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their utmoſt endeavour, to make their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Election ſure, in improving the Talent that he hath given them, therefore they will not be choſen of him. All theſe controverſal points being clearly Anſwered, where I ſpoke of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.7.8. <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my Son; but the fearful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, and the abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liers, ſhall have their part in the Lake<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45720:186"/>which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> Now whereas he here ſaith the fearful. That is, thoſe that are miſtruſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearful of the Promiſes, Power, or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God, and therefore throw themſelves out of the way of his Mercy, either by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, or preſumptiouſly running into all exceſs of Riot. Now as a miſtruſtful fear in God ſhall be puniſhed with Hell Fire; ſo on the contrary, them that are fearful by reaſon of their own weakneſs, leaſt they ſhould miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are promiſed by the Lord, deliverance, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. <hi>And deliver them, who through fear of Death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, whereas God ſaith by <hi>Moſes, Dan.</hi> 32.40. that he lives for ever. And alſo it is ſaid of the material Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi>
7.14. that it abideth for ever. Yet ever cannot comprehend what is here expreſſed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5,6. But God may ſometimes uſe this method in ſpeaking, as to himſelf, and other things, by ſuch words as do fall ſhort of expreſſing the full meaning of that is ſignified to us by them; becauſe he hath a ſecret in his word, which nothing but Prayer, Self-Reſignation, and Meditation can give us a light therein, as to the underſtanding of it (and as to the Propheſies, time has much explained, if we in the forementioned way conſider it.) And we alſo are to take notice, that altho ever is attributed to that which cannot be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it; yet Eternity, or Everlaſting is never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to that which cannot reach it. But<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45720:186"/>God is termed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. <hi>The Eternal God, and the Everlaſting Father.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.
<hi>Chriſt is become the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> And it is alſo ſaid, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 96.10. <hi>The Earth is fixed, that it cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> That is, ſo as to become nothing, or as not to be Earth. The whole Earth will never be turned for ever into a burning Mountain; neither will it for ever lie as a waſte Chaos, but as God hath promiſed, it ſhall become a New Earth; that is, a Renewed Earth. And unto that part which God hath aſſign'd the fire, there ſhall it be bounded; which is to part of the Land of the figurative <hi>Eſau,</hi> of which
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes mention, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.5,7,9,10. Now whereas it is ſaid, in <hi>Geneſis</hi> 8.21. <hi>The Lord ſmelled a ſweet Savour, and the Lord ſaid in his heart, I will not again curſe the ground any more for man's ſake, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his Youth: Neither will</hi> I <hi>again ſmite any more every living thing, as I have done. While the Earth remaineth, Seed-time, and Harveſt, and Cold and Heat, Summer and Winter, and Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>God</hi> doth never more curſe all the ground, neither again ſmite any more every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thing, as he hath done; then the Earth cannot be made a perpetual Deſolation. Now whereas God ſaith in the following Verſe, While the Earth remaineth, there ſhould be Seed-time, and Harveſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The which Farth here ſpoken of ſeems to ſignifie the People of<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45720:187"/>the Earth, or the Earth of People; that whilſt the Earthly Body of Man remains, there ſhall be Seed-time and Harveſt, and the like. And what <hi>God</hi> ſaith in the following Chapter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.11,12. doth ſeem to make it ſo appear. For he ſaith, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall all fleſh be cut off any more by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Flood, neither ſhall there any more be a Flood to deſtroy the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we know, that it was not the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Earth that was deſtroyed, but the Earth of People. Now in the 12th verſe, God ſaith,
<hi>I will make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations.</hi> 13. v. <hi>I do ſet my Bow in the Cloud, and it ſhall be for a Token of a Covenant between me and the Earth.</hi> Here again God terms the people of the Earth to be the Earth.</p>
                  <p>And whereas God ſaith, to perpetual genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Thereby we are given to underſtand, that there will be perpetually, that is, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting a generation upon the Earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſaith,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.12,13,16. <hi>The Bow ſhall be in the Cloud, and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlaſting Covenant between God, and every living Creature, of all fleſh that is upon the Earth.</hi> Here <hi>God</hi> has explain'd what was the Earth, which in the 13th verſe he made a Covenant with. Which is here ſet down to be with every living creature of all fleſh. Now for <hi>God</hi> to look on the Bow in the Cloud, to remember the Everlaſting Covenant<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45720:187"/>between himſelf and every living Creature; The which Covenant would be void, if God ſhould deſtroy every living Creature of all fleſh from off the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith, Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away; that is, the Powers with the People. And whereas he ſaith, paſs away, it argues, that it will not be a ſudden moving; but that there will be a time of puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them here before their departure; of which
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.9. <hi>Thou ſhalt break them with a Rod of Iron; thou ſhalt daſh them in peices like a Potters Veſſel.</hi> And where <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of the Judgment of this World, he ſaith, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12. <hi>As concerning the reſt of the Beaſt, they had their Dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a ſeaſon and a time.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27. <hi>He ſhall rule them with a Rod of Iron, as the Veſſels of a Potter ſhall they be broken to ſhivers.</hi> And alſo it is ſaid of the Lord,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Out of his mouth went a ſharp Sword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he ſhall rule them with a Rod of Iron; and he treadeth the Wine-preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of the Almighty God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all this it doth plainly appear, that there will be a time of puniſhment upon the Earth, when the Lord is againcome, before the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are turned into Hell. And to make this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear, it is ſaid,
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 112.10. <hi>That the wicked ſhall gnaſh their Teeth, when they ſee the vengeance.</hi> Now St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh in the words
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45720:188"/>of the Lord, as touching the Heavens and the Earth, which are at the coming of the Lord. For he ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. <hi>The firſt Heavens and the firſt Earth are paſſed away.</hi> Which Heavens and Earth are the Wicked Powers, with the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked People.</p>
                  <p>Now at the final and laſt Judgment, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth are ſaid to fly away; the which ſhews a more haſty motion, and, as I apprehend, by the Heavens is meant, <hi>Iſraels</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over the reſt of the Nations; and by the Earth, the ſerviceableneſs of other Nations to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And that at the final Judgment, that diſtinction may no longer continue, and ſo ſaid to fly away, as not to have place found for them; For after Death is caſt into Hell, there will be no more dying; and when they are become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, there will not be that need of ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs the one to the other. And not only ſo, but the Elementary Body of Man will then fly away, and no more place alſo found for it, this being according to the promiſe God made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Gen.</hi>
17.8. <hi>And I will give unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, all the Land of Canaan for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting poſſeſſion, and I will be their God.</hi> And the like God hath ſworn in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> as I have already proved, that he will give them the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> for an everlaſting poſſeſſion. And in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 66 22. God ſaith, <hi>As the New Heavens and the New Earth which I will make ſhall remain before me, ſaith the Lord, ſo ſhall your ſeed and your name remain.</hi>

And we, reading neither in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> nor in the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> of any that was caſt alive into the lake of Fire, but the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, which makes me conjecture, there may be no other of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed raiſed at that time, but what has ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>And now according to the Word of the Lord in <hi>Daniel,</hi> there has been ſuch a time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as never was ſince there has been a Nation, with Blood and Fire, and Vapour of Smoke. By which Rivers of Fire, Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Hell hath enlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure; and their Glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it.</hi> 16. <hi>And the Lord of hoſts ſhall be exalted in Judgment, and God that is Holy, ſhall be ſanctified in righteouſneſs.</hi> 17.
<hi>Then ſhall the Lambs feed after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the waſte places of the fat ones ſhall ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is ſpoken for the time now a coming, by Hells enlarging her ſelf, and the wicked's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into it; at which time, it is ſaid, the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be exalted; at which time it is alſo ſaid the Lambs ſhall feed after their manner: Therefore this muſt relate to the time of the Judgment of this World, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of all things. Now, as it is ſaid in <hi>Daniel, There ſhall be ſuch trouble, as never<pb n="255" facs="tcp:45720:190"/>was ſince there has been a Nation.</hi> And now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Angel, There has been ſuch trouble, at this time, as has not been ſince there has been a Nation, with the like amazing Earth-quakes, which has been in ſeveral places, with the Cities of the Nations falling, with oft Eruptions of Fire, breaking forth of Hell, with the continual Wars of long ſtanding, and neither Conquering one the other, with that great Mortality which has lately been in <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> and there about, to above a Million of Souls. All theſe things being the Signs that God and Chriſt hath given us, that thereby we might prepare for the Coming of the Lord, for he ſaith, when his Judgments are upon the Earth, let the Inhabitants of the world learn Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now theſe Judgments are the Lord's continual Whirl-winds, which is ſpoken of in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> That <hi>Iſrael</hi> and we ſhould conſider it perfectly; and we alſo have had the ſigns of Good amongſt us, in token of the great Jubile, or Sabbatiſm of reſt, in that there was a Field of Corn in <hi>Kent,</hi> came up of it ſelf, which has not been before ſince the Creation: Alſo with the Miraculous Cure of <hi>Mary Malliard;</hi> the which being clear ſigns of the great Jubile, when all things ſhall grow of themſelves; at which time alſo, it is ſaid, the Lame ſhall leap as an Hart. And then after the Lord is again come, will be kept New Moons and Sabbaths, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
66.23. and ſolemn Aſſemblies, with the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:45720:191"/>as in <hi>Zac.</hi> 14.17,21. and Sacrifices, but what thoſe Sacrifices will be, we know not. And then there ſhall again be Altars to the Lord, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.19. but whether thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars will be more than for Offering of Incenſe, and ſweet ſmelling ſavours is uncertain: But there was free-will-Offerings before the Law, and the like. Then will there be greatneſs in the Church again: But in this time Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>He that will be chiefeſt among you, ſhall be ſervant to all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.8. <hi>For all tables are full of Vomit and Filthineſs, ſo that there is no place clean.</hi> 9. <hi>Whom ſhall he teach Knowledg, and whom ſhall he make to underſtand Doctrine, them that are weaned from the Milk, and drawn from the breaſts.</hi> 10. <hi>For Precept muſt be upon Precept, Precepts upon Precept, Line upon Line, Line upon Line, here a little, and there a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> 11. <hi>For with ſtammering Lips and another Tongue, will he ſpeak to this People.</hi> 12. <hi>To whom he ſaid, this is the reſt wherewith ye may cauſe the weary to reſt, and this is the tefreſhing, yet they would not hear.</hi> 13. <hi>But the word of the Lord was unto them, precept upon precept, precept upon pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>cept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a little, that they might go and fall backward, and be broken, and ſnared and taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith, Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line, that is, of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and admonitions, ſhewing us what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requires of us, that we may walk in obedience<pb n="257" facs="tcp:45720:191"/>thereunto. But if we regard it not, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies whereby the ſecret of the Word is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, is but ſet down here a little and there a little. And God here tells why he hath ſo placed it, is becauſe that thoſe that will go on in their own wicked ways, may be ſnared, broken and taken.</p>
                  <p>According to which it was with the Jews at the Lord's firſt Coming: To them he was laid in <hi>Sion</hi> as a ſtumbling ſtone, but to all them that walked in the Law of the Lord blameleſly, none of them were left to ſtumble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6.
<hi>Touching the righteouſneſs which is in the Law, he was blameleſs.</hi> And it is ſaid in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. of <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth. They were both Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid they were both Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. That is, they were ſincerely obedient to all the Commandments of God, and did not wilfully break, or neglect any, and therefore term'd Righteous. For to walk in ſincerity with God, is the only perfection that man in himſelf can attain to. And altho St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, The Law makes no Man perfect, yet walking in the Law blameleſly made them accepted. And altho St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was ignorantly a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, yet becauſe he walked in Integrity with God, and blameleſly in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, therefore he ſound mercy with<pb n="258" facs="tcp:45720:192"/>God; and neither Jew nor Proſylife that ſo did, but was brought into the Knowledg of the Lord. And whereas the young man ſaith, He kept the Commandments, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.19,20,21,22. yet the Lord told him, he lacked one thing; and bid him go ſell what he had, and give to the poor; for which ſaying he went away ſorrowful. But it is not likely, the Lord did for ever ſo part with him; for it is ſaid the Lord loved him. And what the Lord here ſaith, as to his ſelling his Eſtate, and giving it to the Poor, was as well to inſtruct the Church, by reaſon they were not long to have inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there, the which all the Church followed, after the Crucifixion of the Lord. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26.
<hi>Men and Brethren, Children of the Stock of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and whoſoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this Salvation ſent.</hi> By which it is clear, that none was left of God to blindneſs of Mind, that truly fear'd his Name. And ſo now it is with us as 'twas with the Jews, that our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances here, will ſignify little to us.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.13. <hi>For all the Prophets, and the Law Propheſied until</hi> John. That is, until
<hi>John</hi> there was a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Prophets, and the whole Law was of force until <hi>John,</hi> after which the Ceremonial Law was Aboliſhed. But the Moral Law, and ſome of the Propheſies of the Antient Prophets,

                  <p>And he further ſaith, 'Tis thoſe of the Inner-Court, that ſhall be left as a Seed to partake of the Glory.</p>
                  <p>And alſo good Mr. <hi>George Withers</hi> ſaith, The Lord will again come, whom the Jews do expect.</p>
                  <p>And alſo Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> witneſſed it with his Death. And all the Scriptures do agree in foretelling the ſecond coming of the Lord, and other good men, whom God hath open'd their Eyes to underſtand the ſame; with the evident ſigns that were foretold ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of the Lord, as now if we will be wilfully ignorant of the Truth, we muſt take what follows.</p>

                  <p>I am apt to believe the firſt Blaſing-Star that was ſeen in 1662, of which it was ſaid, it was a rod to whip the World withal, which I take to be the firſt ſign that God gave notice of the near approaching Judgment of this World; and ſince we have had ſeveral Blazing-Stars, and continual Signs: As the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repeated Earth-quakes, and the Cities of the Nations falling, with the repeated Rivers and Floods of Fire out of the Earth, and W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance and ſupplication for all ſaints.</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45720:204"/>Praying always, that is, praying dayly. Which is, as if any one gives us our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly food, as long as we live, we ſay that they continually give us our food: Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Prayer: That is upon all occaſions, for our ſelves, and for the Saints, and for all Men that have not excluded themſelves from his mercy. And St.
<hi>John</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">1 John 2.4,5.</note>
                     <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoſo keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: hereby know we that we are in him.</hi> That is, if our wills are brought over to be truly obedient, and if ſo, there will not want an earneſt endeavour to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in a holy life. Which is unlike thoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Titus</hi> ſpeaks of, That

                     <hi>profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi> How think you it will then prove with ſuch in the great day? For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1.7,8,9.</note>
                     <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> I hope this dreadful ſentence will awaken many ſleeping Chriſtians before it is too<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45720:204"/>late. Therefore to day, whilſt it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day, harden not your hearts, but make preparation for the Bridegroom of your Souls. Now as to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.30.</note>
                     <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, that the Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſneſs, even the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of faith.</hi> That is, the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> that were firſt brought home to Chriſt by the call of the Goſpel, no ſooner ſavingly believed in the Lord Jeſus, as to accept him as he is tendred in the Goſpel, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, as though they had never ſinned. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That
<note place="margin">Col. 2.10,11.</note>

                     </gap>hem they were created in Chriſt Jeſus to <pb n="52" facs="tcp:45720:205"/>good works, you ſee alſo in the ſame ver. he tells them, that God had ordained that they ſhould walk in them. And he ſaith likewiſe,
<note place="margin">Col. 2.6,7.</note>
                     <hi>As ye have therefore received Christ Jeſus the Lord; ſo walk ye in him, rooted and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the faith, as ye have been taught, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therein with thanksgiving.</hi> And he ſaith farther,
<note place="margin">Col. 3.1,2,3,4,5,6.</note>
                     <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is had with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt who is your life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory. Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is Idolatry: For which things ſake, the wrath of God cometh on the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience.</hi> For we are not only to ſhun the doing evil, but we muſt alſo learn to do well. And whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.31,32.</note>
                     <hi>But Iſrael, which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righteouſneſs. Wherefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law, for they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that ſtumbling ſtone.</hi> That is, they ſought it by the righteouſneſs of the works of the ceremonial Law; which conſiſted<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45720:205"/>in ſacrifices, waſhings, and often purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Of which the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1,2.</note>
                     <hi>For the law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect. For then would they have ceaſed to be offered, becauſe that the worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more conſcience of ſin.</hi> Now this was the Law to which
<hi>Iſrael</hi> truſted, to take away their ſin: Of which Law or Statutes, God ſaith,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.25.</note>
                     <hi>they were not good.</hi> Becauſe, as it is ſaid in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> they were but a ſhadow of the good things to come, and therefore could not make the comers thereunto perfect. But had <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> employed their utmoſt diligence in their obedience to the moral Law, they had not been left to ſtumble at that ſtumbling ſtone, as God by the Prophets hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And alſo Chriſt himſelf ſaith,
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.23,24.</note>
                     <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites, for ye pay tithe of mint, and aniſe, and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and have omitted the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith; theſe ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides, which ſtrain at a gnat, and ſwallow a camel.</hi> And again he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19.16,17.</note>
                     <hi>One came and ſaid unto him, good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may inherit eternal life. And the Lord<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45720:206"/>ſaid unto him, if thou wilt enter into life keep the Commandments.</hi> And again,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.25,26,27,28.</note>
                     <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came unto the Lord, ſaying, Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life. He ſaid unto him, What is written in the Law, how readeſt thou? And he anſwering, ſaid, thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy ſelf. And he ſaid unto him, Thou haſt anſwered right, this do, and thou ſhalt live.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.6,7,8,9,10,11.</note>
                     <hi>The righteouſneſs which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe: Say not in thine heart, who ſhall aſcend into heaven, that is to bring Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, that is to bring up Chriſt again from the dead. But what ſaith it, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For the Scripture ſaith,
<hi>whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> The which word of faith mentioned in the 8. v. comprehends all that is contained in the Goſpel relating to man's ſalvation: Wherein is declared Chriſt coming from<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45720:206"/>Heaven, his riſing again from the dead, with the conditions on which Chriſt and Salvation is offered. The knowledge of which he ſaith was in their mouth, and in their heart; it being that which he had preached to them. And whereas he ſaith in the 9. v.
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.9.</note>
                     <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Now this verſe, as they have parted the words, is a contradiction to all the Scripture; but the words that go before, and the verſe that follows after, explain the Apoſtles meaning. Where he ſaith in the 10. v.
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.10</note>
                     <hi>For with the heart man believeth unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The which, we no ſooner are converted, but we reſign up our ſelves to him, deſiring in all things to walk ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to him, the which if we ſo do, we may believe that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us: For it is only the ſincerity of the heart, as to the truth of their belief, which will produce a holy life according to the will of God. For it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.12,14.</note>
                     <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Now what the Apoſtle here ſaid in the 9. v. was to the Church that he had before inſtructed, and of whom he had had proof of their ſincerity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incouraged them to go on in the open acknowledging and confeſſing of the <pb n="56" facs="tcp:45720:207"/>Lord, although they were but a few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, amongſt a multitude of Heathens. And that their faith might not flag, as to God's raiſing Chriſt from the dead, he lets them underſtand, it was a great point of their Salvation, according to what he ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.14,16,17.</note>
                     <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is alſo vain. For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed; and if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your ſins.</hi> By which we ſee it is one of the material points of our Salvation. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.12,13,14.</note>
                     <hi>There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek; for the ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved. How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed?</hi> Here we ſee in theſe verſes he ſpeaks in general to all, but in the 9. v. he ſpeaks to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular People, or Perſons, to whom he wrote. Now in the 12. v. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek.</hi> That is, ſalvation was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like common, to all that did alike call upon him. And whereas he ſaith in the 13. v.
<hi>Whoſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I hope that you do not here apprehend that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a vocal voice, that if they ſo call, that they ſhall be ſaved: No, it is the<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45720:207"/>voice of the heart, that there may be a ſuitable frame of Spirit, whereby we may call upon God as is required; for it is the tongue that expreſſeth but the meaning or voice of the heart; and the tongue is not the man, but a ſmall member of him. And had we no tongue to expreſs our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, yet the ſincerity of our heart, in our affections towards God, and being ſenſible of our own unworthineſs, is that voice which the Lord will hear. And like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this was the voice of the Malefactor that was crucified with Chriſt, who in the ſence of his own unworthineſs, and of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, called on the Lord for mercy;<note place="margin">Luk. 23.40,41,42,43.</note> faith in him being ſtrong; when the Lord was moſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and eclipſed, which made his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on him at that time more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but it was the Lord look'd in upon his heart, he not before having ſlighted his mercy: Therefore this is no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, that live under the call of the Goſpel, to deferr repentance. For the day of grace, and the day of life, have not one and the ſame date: For if we will go on frowardly in the ways of our own hearts, God will leave us to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart. Now God ſaid that <hi>David</hi> was a Man after his own heart; and why, becauſe his heart imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly anſwered the call of God by his<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45720:208"/>Word or Meſſengers, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.8.</note>
                     <hi>When thou ſaidſt, Seek ye my face, my heart anſwered unto thee, thy face, Lord, will I ſeek.</hi> This is the voice which God requires of us: The which he found not in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.21.</note>
                     <hi>To Iſrael he ſaith, all the day long I have ſtretched forth my hands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſobedient and gainſaying People.</hi> And alſo in <hi>Proverbs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 1.24,26.</note>
                     <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded. I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi> By this we may plainly ſee, God complain'd of them, becauſe they were wanting to themſelves, in not improving the ſeaſon of grace which he had put into their hands. Therefore God ſaith in the 32. v.
<note place="margin">Prov. 1.32,33.</note>
                     <hi>The turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them. But whoſoever ſhall hearken unto me, ſhall dwell ſafely, and be quiet from fear of evil.</hi> What is here ſpoken, is to the fooliſh and wiſe Chriſtians; and of the near approaching time to come. Now the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſent preſently after their converſion, when as dayly there were new converts brought over to the Church, for their comfort to let them underſtand, that if they ſhould immediatly after their converſion be taken away by a natural death, or a violent one upon the account of their faith, that they<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45720:208"/>ſhould no ways be ſtartled or diſmayed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not time after their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to do any good action, even ſo much time, as to be baptized, but only believed as the Thief did, and thereupon called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord for mercy, and ſo departed this life, yet they ſhould be ſaved; upon which occaſion they were baptized for the dead, as the ancients ſay; and of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.29.</note>
                     <hi>What ſhall they do, which are baptized for the dead? if the dead riſe not at all, why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi> Now that they that call upon God ſo as to have ſalvation, his following words make out, where the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note>
                     <hi>How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed.</hi> By which we ſee their calling is inſignificant without believing, and if they ſavingly believe, it muſt be according to the tenor of the Goſpel: Which requires of us repentance from dead works, and love to, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and if we live, amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life; for he that is in Chriſt, muſt become a new Creature; and walk as he himſelf walked.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.6.</note> And as St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.1,8.</note>
                     <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> 6. <hi>v. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded is life and peace.</hi> By which we may plainly ſee St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning was<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45720:209"/>not, that they might remain in their own natural ſtate, and ſo call upon God and be ſaved, but that his meaning was, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewed you; for what is ſet down here, and what is ſet down in the 10. Ch. was writ at one and the ſame time, being one and the ſame Epiſtle. And the <hi>Jews</hi> wiſely tell us, that we muſt look to the words which go before, and the words that follow after, if we intend to come to a right underſtanding of the Scripture. Now God by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> makes mention of the miſcarriage of <hi>Judah,</hi> and how ſhe did but feignedly call upon him, as in the 10. v.
<note place="margin">Jer. 3.10.</note>
                     <hi>And yet for all this, her treacherous Siſter Judah hath not turned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.16,17,18.</note>
                     <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or obedience unto righteouſneſs. But God be thanked, that you were the ſervants of ſin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from ſin, ye became the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of righteouſneſs.</hi> The which is an evident token that we have no ſhare in Chriſt's righteouſneſs, if we our ſelves walk not in the ways of righteouſneſs: And alſo, we ſin our ſins over again, if we do but delightfully think on<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45720:209"/>them. And the Apoſtle relates to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> what they were, before they were converted.
<note place="margin">Titus 3.3,4,5,6,7,8.</note>
                     <hi>For we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes foolish, diſobedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice, and envy, hateful, and hating one another. But after that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. Which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. That being juſtified by his grace, ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that you affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good works.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle having here ſet down what they were before the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared. And whereas he ſaid, <hi>Not by the works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which they had done, but according to his mercy he ſaved them by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here we ſee was an inward change wrought in them, from whence did ariſe their hopes of ſalvation. And whereas he ſaid that the Spirit was ſhed on them abundantly, it was for the eſtabliſhing the Goſpel. And as to what he ſaith as<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45720:210"/>to their being juſtified by his grace, they ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life: That is, as I before told you, upon their firſt converſion and reſigning themſelves up to Chriſt, to be wholly guided and governed by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of his word; then it is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to them, whereby they become juſtified in ſight of God. <hi>And whereas he ſaith, I will that they affirm conſtantly that they that have believed in God might be carefull to maintain good works.</hi> The which he ſaid to let them underſtand, that if they did not perſevere in a holy life, they might be caſt off. According to what the Lord ſaith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 15.2.6,8,9,10,14.</note>
                     <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away, and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. If a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch and is withered, and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned. Herein is my father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my diſciples. As the father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue in my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my fathers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abide in his love. Ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> By all theſe words of the Lord it is fully
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45720:210"/>evident, that although we were grafted in him, and beloved of him, yet if we bear not fruit, and keep not his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſhall neither remain in him, nor be beloved of him. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 1.6,8.</note>
                     <hi>I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel.</hi> And he ſaith in the 8. v. <hi>But though we or an angel from heaven, preach another Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Now by the words of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> there was deceivers got in among the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> which would have brought them to circumciſion, and made them alſo to obſerve the ceremonial law. Therefore he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note>
                     <hi>I Paul ſay unto you, that if you be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And again he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.16.</note>
                     <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</hi> Now whereas he ſaith, no man is juſtified by the works of the law: That is, man is not able to fulfil all the works of the law in that perfection as is required of him: Neither can it take away original ſin, ſo as a man cannot become juſtified
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45720:211"/>by it, yet they were ſo far able to fulfill the law, as to walk blameleſly in it, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. And in the Old Teſtament time, accepted of God for it, through the then promiſed Meſſiah. And whereas he ſaith, not by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt: That is, by the faith that Jeſus Chriſt requires of us. And he ſaith, we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt. Now whereas he ſaith, they had believed in Chriſt, that includes a belief in his whole revealed will in his word. And in his word he tells us, <hi>if we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into life, we muſt keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> by what he here ſaith, hath no intention to take them off the moral law; for they cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if after they are received into the Church of Chriſt, they will not walk in obedience to it. But it is the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law, which ſome falſe Brethren would have brought in to have burthened the Church withal, whereby they would have made the ſufferings of Chriſt of none effect, for man's ſalvation and juſtification. Therefore he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1,2,3,4,5,6.</note>
                     <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, crucified among you. This only would I learn of you, receive ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45720:211"/>hearing of faith? Are ye ſo fooliſh, having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect in the fleſh? Have ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain, if it be yet in vain.</hi> Here we ſee that theſe <hi>Galatians</hi> had upon the preaching of the Goſpel received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that they had ſuffered many things as the Church of Chriſt: Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> was here afraid of their final fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off, by reaſon of deceivers that were got in among them; which would have had them truſted to Circumciſion, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and Sacrifices for Juſtification, and not unto Chriſt: Which Laws were all aboliſhed at the death of Chriſt; he being that only Sacrifice that could make ſatisfaction to take away ſin; and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrifices were but to figure out him, who was alone able to make that great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement with God. Therefore St.
<hi>Paul</hi> reproves them ſharply, that having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the Spirit, they ſhould think to be made perfect by the fleſh. And he ſaith to them in the
5. v. <hi>He therefore that miniſtreth to you the ſpirit, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith.</hi> 6. v. <hi>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Faith or belief in us toward God and Chriſt, conſiſts of three diſtinct parts; firſt a belief in, and a practical conſent<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45720:212"/>to the conditions, upon which life and ſalvation is offered by God! the ſecond is a belief in the power and faithfulneſs of the promiſer, for the thing promiſed. The third is, an intire affection, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thankfulneſs, to the promiſer, for the thing promiſed. Now theſe three things were found in the belief of faithful
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> for he left his own Country to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord, and gave himſelf wholly up to love and obey him, as witneſs the offering of his Son; and alſo judging him faithful, that had promiſed him the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of himſelf, in the foregoing Chap.
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.19,20.</note>
                     <hi>For I through the law, am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</hi> That is, dead to the ceremonial law, not to the moral law, for he as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the law of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment, for which the Lord did confirm his promiſe to <hi>Abraham.</hi> As in the 19. v.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45720:212"/>of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> We ſee here, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was crucified with Chriſt. That is, he was dead to the World, and to the pleaſures thereof; yet he ſaid that he lived, yet he ſays again, not I but Chriſt liveth in me. That is, he had ſo wholly given himſelf up to Chriſt, and brought down his thoughts into ſubjection unto him, ſo as Chriſt had the reigning power in him, ſo as the life which he then lived was by faith in the Son of God: Which faith was, he had brought down his will into ſubjection to Chriſt, in hopes to obtain eternal ſalvation by him, and his love a full ſatisfaction. Therefore he ſaith, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſpoken of the righteouſneſs of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.7,8.</note>
                     <hi>Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith, the ſame are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham.

Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon every Soul of man that doeth evil, <pb n="72" facs="tcp:45720:215"/>of the Jew first, and alſo of the Gentile. But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew firſt and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the Gentile. For there is no reſpect of Perſons with God. For as many as have ſinned without the law, ſhall alſo periſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the law; and as many as have ſinned in the law, ſhall be judged by the law. For not the hearers of the law are juſtified before God, but the doers of the law ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> That is, as I tell you they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their firſt converſion and reſignation juſtified by their faith in Chriſt but after we are converted, and juſtified by faith, then whilſt we have life, we muſt uſe our diligence to walk in obedience and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs in the fear of the Lord. And here we ſee he acknowledges the moral law to the greateſt height, and tells us, that we muſt be judged by it and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> For he ſaith in the 16. v.
<hi>In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.14</note>
                     <hi>We must be diligent that we may be found of him in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith again,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.13,14,15.</note>
                     <hi>Wherefore gird up the loyns of your mind, be ſober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. As obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children, not faſhioning your ſelves according to the former luſts, in your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: <pb n="73" facs="tcp:45720:215"/>But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> That is, endeavour to be holy in all your converſations. And as it is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note>
                     <hi>Follow peace with all men, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> By which we ſee nothing but a cloſe walking with Chriſt, will keep us in the love of Chriſt; for if we ſin willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after we have thus received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, I find no hope of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: for the greater light we ſin againſt, the greater condemnation we fall under, as witneſs, when the Lord was in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the man that gathered ſticks on the Sabbath day, was utterly cut off from the Congregation of the Lord.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.29,30,31,32,35.</note> Becauſe he deſpiſed the word of the Lord, therefore was he cut off in his iniquity, and was ſtoned to death. So alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the evident manifeſtations of the Spirit of God in the Apoſtles time, we ſee in the <hi>Acts</hi> by <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife,<note place="margin">Acts 5.1,2,3,4,5.</note> that having joyned themſelves to the Church, and in that they hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally would appear in the ſight of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles more devoted to the intereſt of the Church, then really they were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells them, they had not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto man, but unto God; for he ſaith likewiſe,
<hi>whiles it remained, was it not thine own, and after it was ſold, was it not <pb n="74" facs="tcp:45720:216"/>in thine own power, why haſt thou conceived this in thine heart, thou haſt not lyed unto men, but unto God. And Ananias hearing theſe words, fell down and gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> By which we ſee, of what dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is for us to pretend to be more holy than we really are. Therefore let this be a warning to us, to be better than we pretend to be; for 'tis God that knoweth the heart, and tryeth the Spirits of men. And alſo God ſaith,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.12.</note>
                     <hi>Therefore thou Son of man, ſay unto the Children of thy people, the righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall not deliver him in the day of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: as for the wickedneſs of the wicked, he ſhall not fall thereby in the day that he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from his wickedneſs, neither ſhall the righteous be able to live for his righteouſneſs in the day that he ſinneth.</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.5,6</note>
                     <hi>that if they willfully ſin, after they have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the World to come, they cannot be renewed by repentance.</hi> For if we are only of the outward Church, we fall ſhort of Salvation, and muſt have our ſhare in the threatned miſery; and if we deferr repentance, and check the good motions of the Spirit, we thereby loſe the day of grace, and ſo are left of God. And if we go to hear the word, and do not benefit thereby, we are like the Earth which drinketh in the rain,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.3.</note> yet bearing thorns<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45720:216"/>and briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned. And if we are willfully ignorant: It is ſaid, it is only the Fool hates knowledge.<note place="margin">Pro.
1.22.</note> And God ſaith, my People are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge.<note place="margin">Hoſea 4.6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas the Lord ſaith,
<note place="margin">John 5.20,21,22,23,24.</note>
                     <hi>For the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things that himſelf doeth: and he will ſhew him greater works than theſe, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them, even ſo the Son quickneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son.</hi> By this we may plainly ſee, that Chriſt ſpake this for the time to come, in which he will jduge the World; for when he then came, it was to teach, and to ſuffer; and now, as he is at the right hand of God, it is ſaid, he ſits there as an Advocate with the Father, but when he comes again, he is then our Judge; therefore this is ſpoken for that time, when all judgment ſhall be given to him. The Lord ſaith, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him.</hi> Now the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Turks</hi> honour him not as they do the Father; therefore ſpoken for time to come. And he ſaith, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and <pb n="76" facs="tcp:45720:217"/>believeth on him that ſent me hath everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, and ſhall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> That is, when the Lord again cometh, that them which he then findeth thus, will have everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but then will be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from death unto life. And he ſaith,
<note place="margin">John 5.24,25,26,27,28,29.</note>
                     <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear ſhall live. For as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> By all the foregoing words it doth evidently appear to be the firſt reſurrection, the which will be at the coming of the Lord, and here ſpoken in the uſual way of Scripture ſpeaking; in mentioning that which is to come, as though it were already come. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wicked are termed to be dead in ſin, yet in the foregoing words, there was made no mention of them, but of the judgment that was committed to Chriſt. Neither is the voice of Chriſt after his Aſcenſion, ſaid to call home any but St.
<hi>Paul.</hi> And the Holy Ghoſt was not given, till after the People were brought home by the voice of his Meſſengers in the call of the Goſpel. Therefore this muſt needs be meant of the firſt Reſurrection, which will be when Chriſt again cometh. And<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45720:217"/>the Lord ſaith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.27,28,29.</note>
                     <hi>And hath given him Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to execute judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of God.</hi> We ſee all along here, that the Lord ſpeaks of his power and judgment, when he again comes. And again he ſaith, <hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice. And ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the reſurrection of damnation.</hi> Here the Lord ſpeaks in the Scripture way of ſpeaking, in that he ſo nearly joyns his coming to judge the World with that laſt judgment like that of his joyning the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the World together, according to which all the Scripture is ſo joyn'd. Now theſe two judgments, are clearly to diſtinct things; for in the firſt, it is ſaid, the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and it was thoſe that did hear, did live, therefore this is at the firſt reſurrection, when the Lord again comes, at which time all the promiſs'd Elect ſhall be call'd in whom he hath promiſed mercy, and with the dead Bodies of the Saints, ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God and live. And the other, is the eternal judgment, which is ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> where it is ſaid, the Sea, and Death, and Hell delivered up the dead. As to what<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45720:218"/>the Lord ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 5. from the 20. v. to the 29. v. The Lord there ſpeaks of the two judgments, as I have elſewhere proved to you; and therefore what he ſaith in the 24. v. is concerning them that are believers at his coming, that they have everlaſting life, and that they ſhall not come into condemnation; but where the Lord ſaith,
<note place="margin">John. 6.47</note>
                     <hi>Verily, verily. I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me hath everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life.</hi> And the Apoſtle alſo ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 John 5.11,12,13.</note>
                     <hi>This is the record, that God hath given us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life.</hi> That is, God hath renewed us in Chriſt, and given us eternal life by him, if we are true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and what that belief is that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us, I have elſewhere proved to you. But the everlaſting life that is given the Believer, is as it was given
<hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the which was as long as he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his obedience. And ſo it is with us; the which, the words of the Lord doth fully explain; where he ſaith,
<note place="margin">John 8.51</note>
                     <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verily, I ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſayings, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith again,
<note place="margin">John 15.9,10,11,12.</note>
                     <hi>As the Father hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, ſo have I loved you, continue ye in<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45720:218"/>my love. If ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love: even as I kept my Fathers commandments and abide in his love. Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full. This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> By all this we plainly ſee, that the eternal life given the Believer, is theirs no longer than they perſiſt in their obedience: So <hi>Adam</hi>'s eternal life that he had given him in Paradiſe, was loſt by his offending; for had he perſiſted in his obedience, he had never dyed. And as I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to you, that if we are regenerated, ſo as our wills are brought over into an intire reſignation of our ſelves to God and Chriſt, then we are accepted of him; and then is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us; but it is afterward there comes a day of trial, either by temptation, or affliction, or a cloudy dark day may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake us; and therefore it is beſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true Chriſtian to arm themſelves for the worſt; that they may be able to ſtand in the evil day: ſo, whilſt we continue in our obedience, the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us; and then as the Apoſtle ſaith, are we complete in him, and afterward, what ſins are not willfully committed, will not deſtroy us; becauſe Chriſt is our Advocate with the Father;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:45720:219"/>but let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 John 3.6,7,8.</note>
                     <hi>Whoſoever abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him, ſinneth not; whoſoever ſinneth hath not ſeen him.</hi> That is, they give themſelves no liberty to ſin; and what is not willingly committed, is not imputed. <hi>Little Children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteouſneſs is righteous, even as he is righteous.</hi> That is, if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in well-doing, as I before ſhewed, we have the perfect righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to us, for it is ſaid we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in him. <hi>He that committeth ſin, is of the Devil, for the Devil ſinned from the beginning; for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſt, that be might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> That is, he that willfully committeth ſin is of the Devil; for the Devil committeth no ſin, but what he committeth willfully. And the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 John 1.6,7,8,9.</note>
                     <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> This is that which makes us appear clean and white in the ſight of God. But he ſaith again, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> For we cannot live without ſin, as ſins of infirmity, and ſins of ignorance, and too often overtaken<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45720:219"/>in the ſins of Negligence, and ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with the Sins of Surpriſal. Therefore he ſaith in the 9. v.
<hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful, and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouneſs.</hi> That is, all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſes upon our Converſion are forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, if we ſeek to God by Confeſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. And whereas the Lord ſaith in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.46,47,48. <hi>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye, do not even the Publicans the ſame? and if ye ſalute your Brethren only, what do ye more than others, do not even the Publicans ſo? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, be you perfect, or ſincere in your Love to others, as God was ſincere or perfect in his Love to you, in that he gave the Son of his Love for you, according to his Promiſe. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5,6. <hi>And the Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, increaſe our Faith. And the Lord ſaid, if ye had Faith as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, you might ſay to this Sycamine Tree, be thou pluck up by the Root, and be thou planted in the Sea, and it ſhould obey you.</hi> You might, that is, hereafter ſay to this Sycamine Tree, be thou removed; for at that time the working of Miracles was not given. This alſo was ſpoken of to the Apoſtles. And in that he ſaith to them, that if ye have Faith, as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed; the which was to exclude <hi>Judas,</hi> for he had not the leaſt of that ſaving Faith, which worketh the Heart in Love with Chriſt, and ſo was not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45720:220"/>of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and the working of Miracles with the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. And by the want of this grain, was to ſignify to us, that <hi>Judas</hi> was an inſtrument of
<hi>Satan</hi> all along, according to which is ſaid in <hi>John</hi> 6.70.
<hi>Jeſus anſwered them, have not I choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you twelve, and one of you is a Devil?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not one grain of Faith and Love in him to the Lord Jeſus. But God requireth of us, the whole Heart, and the whole Soul. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than me, is not worthy of me; he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me.</hi> 38. <hi>He that taketh not his Croſs, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> 39. <hi>He that findeth his Life ſhall looſe it, and he that looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Life for my ſake ſhall find it.</hi> That is, whoſoever looſeth the Pleaſures, Advantages and Profits of this World for Chriſt, ſhall find Life everlaſting. And Chriſt ſaith in
<hi>Luke</hi> 17 10. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all thoſe things which are Commanded you, ſay, we are unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we have done that which was our duty to do.</hi> But whoſoever doth their Duty in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, God ordereth them Wages: And he ſaith of his, they do not ſerve me for nought, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10. And God told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he was his exceeding great reward, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. And it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi>
5.9. <hi>Chriſt is become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, will I give to eat of the tree of Life, which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45720:220"/>is in the midſt of the Paradice of God.</hi> And we ought to look to the recompence of reward, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. <hi>For he had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</hi> And it is an Article of our Faith to believe that God is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>For without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God would not have us think that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to us for our Service; but that we are ingaged to him for accepting of us for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And if we are his Servants, we are ſure of a Reward.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Man came to Chriſt with his Son, as in
<hi>Matth.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Lord, have mercy upon my ſon, for he is Lunatick, and ſore vexed, for oft times he falleth into the Fire, and oft into the water.</hi> 16. <hi>And I brought him to thy Diſciples, and they could not cure him.</hi> 17. <hi>Then Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, O faithleſs and perverſe Generation, how long ſhall I be with you, how long ſhall I ſuffer you? bring him hither to me.</hi> 18. <hi>And Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Devil, and he departed out of him, and the Child was cured from that very hour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, O faithleſs and perverſe Generation, how long ſhall I be with you. The which words was, without doubt, to reprove them for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of his Power, in that they brought not the Poſſeſſed to him to be healed. And in the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45720:221"/>19. v. <hi>Then came the Diſciples to Jeſus apart, and ſaid, why could not we caſt him out.</hi> 20. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, becauſe of your unbelief; for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, if ye have Faith, as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay unto this Mountain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhall be impoſſible unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas Jeſus ſaid unto them, becauſe of your unbelief, that was, there was then an unbeliever amongſt the Apoſtles. But Chriſt did alſo let them underſtand, that as many of the Apoſtles as had Faith, as a grain of Muſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſeed then, that they ſhould hereafter do as great Miracles as the removing of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to yonder place: For he farther tells them that nothing ſhall be impoſſible unto them. But by the following words of the Lord, he did declare that this Power was not then given them, as in the 21. v. <hi>How beit this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and faſting.</hi> That is, then they had no other power given them, but what the earneſt Prayers and Faſtings of the Church may produce. But after Chriſt's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, the Apoſtles were given the Holy Ghoſt, and the Working of Miracles, and in ſo wonderful a manner, that on whom they laid their Hands, they did receive the Holy Ghoſt. Yet notwithſtanding theſe wonderful Miracles, this promiſe alſo may have ſome reference to the time when the Lord again comes; For it is a queſtion, but that ſome things might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to do, after they had received<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45720:221"/>the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Working of miracles. But when they ſhall ſit on Thrones, Judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then nothing ſhall be impoſſible under their head Chriſt, for them to do. And they may ſay to that very mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall be ſo. For the Lord, with <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> did but juſt come down from the mountain, where was revealed that glorious Viſion. And we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was on <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> becauſe the glory will be there Revealed, and the mountain cleaving, when the Lord deſcends ſo low, as his feet to ſtand upon, it may be ſo determined by the Lord, that by the word of the Apoſtles, that that Mountain ſhall remove toward the <hi>North</hi> and tovvard the <hi>South,</hi> as in
<hi>Zac.</hi> 14.4.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſon that Chriſt made mention of ſo ſmall a quantity of Faith was, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Diſciples and Servants, afterwards might underſtand, That <hi>Judas</hi> had never any grain of Faith to make his Heart have any love to Chriſt. And by the word Grain of Faith, was
<hi>Judas</hi> Excluded from having any ſhare in thoſe Promiſes. And thoſe promiſes that were made to particular perſons, we are not to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a ſhare in, for they belong not to us, no more than the ſitting upon twelve Thrones, to Judg the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> belongs to us.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.19. <hi>And when the Lord ſaw a Figtree in the way, he came to it, and found noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45720:222"/>thereon, but Leaves only, and ſaid unto it, let no fruit grow on thee hence forward for ever. And preſently the Figtree withered away.</hi>
20. <hi>And when the Diſciples ſaw it, they marvelled, ſaying, how ſoon is the figtree withered away.</hi> 21. <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid unto them, verily, verily, I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if ye have Faith, and doubt not, ye ſhall not only do this which is done to the Figtree, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, if ye ſhall ſay unto this Mountain, be thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and be thou caſt into the Sea, and it ſhall be done.</hi> 22. <hi>And all things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in Prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples, unto whom he afterward gave as great power to, as that of the removing of Mountains, when he ſent upon them the Holy Ghoſt, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of working Miracles; and there is no doubt, but if they had ſaid to the Mountain, be thou removed into the Sea, but it ſhould have been done, as well as when <hi>Elijah</hi> called for Fire to come down from Heaven. But theſe promiſes belong not to us; but thoſe that find they have Power to do theſe Miracles, may believe they do belong to them. Now here is ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betvven vvhat is ſaid in theſe Verſes, and vvhat is ſaid in the former: for there it is ſaid that they ſhall ſay to this Mountain, be thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and it ſhall be done; but in theſe laſt Verſes, it is ſaid, if you ſhall ſay to this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, be you removed, and it ſhall be ſo. In the former, there ſhould be nothing impoſſible for them to do. But in theſe, vvhatſoever they<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45720:222"/>ſhould ask believingly, they ſhould receive.</p>
                  <p>Now as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13,2. <hi>And tho I have the gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all Miſteries, and all knowledg: And tho I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</hi> 3. <hi>Altho I beſtow all my goods to feed the Poor, and tho I give my hody to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe Mountains that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, doth appear to be ſome inbred Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which a man might find ſome incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in; And ſo for fear of Hell, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes terrified, and therefore no longer will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to live in them; having all Faith, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the whole Revealed Will of God in his Word; And therefore when he finds that he in his own ſtrength was not able to overcome them, then he goes to fetch ſtrength from the the Lord, in making his Addreſſes to him, for his Aſſiſtance; and having thereby gain'd pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to remove theſe Mountains; yet if his Heart is not drawn out in the Love of God and Chriſt, thereby he is ſtill nothing, for it is our Love that God requireth, and it is that which will launch with us into the World that is to come. As to that word, which in theſe new Tranſlations, is termed Charity, is in the old Tranſlation, Love, as in the Original; For by Love vve extend our ſelves to God, as vvell as to our fellovv Creatures, vvhich by Charity vve cannot do.</p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:45720:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>Now, as for thoſe places of Scriptvre vvhere Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſaith, he that believeth in me, or he that believeth in Chriſt, ſhall be ſaved, is only in ſhort to remember them of the Lord's Revealed Will in his Word, vvhich if they do ſo believe in the Lord, as to make his Commands and Precepts the rule of their Lives, to live according thereunto, they ſhall be ſaved. The vvhich is a clear demonſtration, that the Lord hath by himſelf, and his Apoſtles, left us Inſtructions, vvhich vve are to believe, by vvhich Salvation is attainable. The vvhich St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s vvords does farther clear, 1

                  <head>Concerning the Indwelling of Chriſt in us.</head>
                  <p>NOW as to Chriſt's being in us, and as to the indwelling of the Spirit with us; I ſhall here ſet down what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be ropro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</hi> Now we are to take notice what he here ſaith in the former part of the verſe; the which was, that we ſhould examin our ſelves whether we are in the Faith, and that we ſhould prove our ſelves; as much as to ſay, that is the way, to know whether Chriſt is in us, or no: And in the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he tells us plainly, how it is Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in us, where he ſaith in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your Hearts by Faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in Love.</hi> By which we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, it is by Faith and Love that Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in our Hearts. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any Man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him him be Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Maranatha.</hi> The which is, let him be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, and if accurſed, beſure he is a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:45720:224"/>Now if the indwellings of Chriſt in us, is by Faith and Love; then the beſt way to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt hath ſuch an Indwelling in us, or no, is by our Obedience to him, in our cloſe walking with him, according to his Revealed Will in his Word. And if ſo, we ſhall have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is the Comforter, more or leſs, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſs with our Spirits that we are the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of the Works of the Fleſh, where he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5, to the 10. v. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is Death, but to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace: Becauſe the carnal mind is entirely againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can be. So then they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God. But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, he is none of his. And if Chriſt be in you, the Body is dead, becauſe of ſin; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is Life, becauſe of righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee that the Spirit here ſpoken of is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a Spirit of Complaiſcency to God and Chriſt, in that their Wills are brought over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Love and Obedience of him. The which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to this effect in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2. to the 8. v. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain glory, but in lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteem other<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45720:224"/>better than themſelves. Look not every man at his own things, but every man alſo to the things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Let this mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus; who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God: But made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men: And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> Now, it was with the Spirit of Love, and this ſubmiſſive Spirit that was in Chriſt, which is required to be in us: The which wholly brings us into Obedience to the will of God. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith to the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5,6. <hi>Whoſoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the word of God perfected, whereby know me that we are in him. He that ſaith he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe forementioned places do fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to us, what is that Spirit of Chriſt, that is required to be in us. And not that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or given to us the working of Miracles, the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, or ſpeaſting with Tongues: Neither that we ſhould expect the Spirits teaching of us, ſo as to ſpeak expreſly to us, as it did at the Eſtabliſhing of the firſt Chriſtian Churches. As to which, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11,12. <hi>I certify you brethren, that the Goſpel which was Preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:45720:225"/>Now the firſt Churches being thus wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully eſtabliſhed by the mighty Power of God, in the pouring forth of his Spirit upon them, for the furtherance of the Goſpel, unto part of which St. <hi>John</hi> wrote this firſt Epiſtle: Which perſons were well inſtructed in the Word; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they received the Holy Ghoſt, which is the anointing which he here ſpeaketh of. And as to what he here ſaith concerning the Word, I ſhall begin at 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24,25,26,27 <hi>Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning; if that which ye have heard from the beginning, ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall tontinue in the Son, and in the Father. And this is the promiſe that he hath promiſed us, even eternal Life. Theſe things have I written unto you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them that ſeduce you. But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but, as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth, and is no Lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye ſhall abide in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here, by theſe Words we are firſt to take notice, that if the Word of God, which they heard from the beginning, did remain in them, they ſhould alſo continue in the Son, and in the Father, ſo as to have Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things he wrote to them, becauſe there were ſome that went about to ſeduce them; therefore he doth admoniſh them, that if the word did remain in them, that then they ſhould continue in the Son, and in the Father.<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45720:225"/>Now whereas he ſaith the Anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you all things. But by the forementioned Caution, that if the word did remain in them, that then they ſhould abide in the Father and the Son: By which it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that if they neglect or ſlight the word, that the Spirit would ſoon withdraw his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comfortable preſence from them. Therefore he ſaith in 1
<hi>John</hi> 2.28,29. <hi>And now little Children abide in him, that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we may have confidence, and not be aſhamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, at his coming.</hi> By which we ſee, that although they had the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, with the Teachings of the Spirit, yet they may ſo grieve the Spirit of Grace, as to tempt God to leave them. Now when the wonderful pourings forth of the Spirit, which was in the Apoſtles time, with the working of Miracles, and ſpeaking with Tongues ceaſed; then did this evident Teaching of the Spirit ceaſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>Now St. <hi>John</hi> writing to the Saints, which had the Anointing of the Spirit, which was, that they had received the Holy Ghoſt, the which was given for the Eſtabliſhing of the Goſpel. He ſaith unto them in the 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2,3,4,5. <hi>Behold, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is. And every Man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:45720:226"/>as he is pure.</hi> Now if we have this Hope, and do not purify our ſelves, it will prove but a vain hope to us. And whereas he ſaith in the 4. v. <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law, for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law. And ye knew that he was manifeſted to take away our ſins, and in him is no no ſin.</hi> That is, he was manifeſted to take away original Sin, and the Sins of the truly Penitent, upon their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and afterwards thoſe ſins that are not wilfully and preſumptuouſly committed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19,20,21. <hi>That God was in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We here ſee, that this invitation, and the not imputing their iniquities, was before their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſo as to have taſted the good word of God, and the Powers of the World to come. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>Whoſoever abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, ſinneth not, whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen him.</hi> Whereas he ſaith, he that abideth in Chriſt ſinneth not: That is, ſinneth not wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and preſumptuouſly, and ſins after converſion, if not wilfully committed, are not imputed. But he that ſinneth preſumptuouſly, hath neither ſeen him nor known him ſavingly. And St. <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:45720:226"/>ſaith in v. 7. <hi>Little Children, let no man deceive you; he that doeth righteouſneſs, is Righteous, even as he is Righteous.</hi> This is no otherwiſe than as to the ſincerity of their Wills and Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, upon which they are accepted, as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Righteous in Chriſt Jeſus; for then it is his Righteouſneſs is imputed to them; for it is ſaid, <hi>Col.</hi>
2.10. <hi>We are compleat in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>John</hi> alſo ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8.
<hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil, for the Devil ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the beginning. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> That is, He that wilfully committeth ſin, is of the Devil, for we ſhall ſtand or fall according to the integrity or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of our wills, the which if that is not right, the man cannot be without ſin. And the which ſin, makes them the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. And of whom God ſaith in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25,26. <hi>They ſet at nought all his Councel, and would none of his reproof. Therefore he ſaith, I will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi> And whereas it is ſaid, for this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Here St. <hi>John</hi> doth not ſpeak in the ordinary Scripture way, of mentioning things that are to come, as though they were already done: But in our plain way of ſpeaking, in that he ſaith, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil; whereby we know that it is not yet done; but that he hath already paid the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45720:227"/>for that which he ſhall have in poſſeſſion at that time of Reſtitution, and then ſhall he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil; For Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 14.30. <hi>Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the Prince of this World cometh, and hath nothing in me.</hi> Now it is Evident, if the Devil be the Prince of this World, Chriſt hath not yet deſtroyed the works of the Devil. And as to what St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in the 9. v. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Now in the former Verſe he makes mention of himſelf, and the Church; and alſo ſaith, they are called the Sons of God; but in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. he neither makes mention of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the Church, but ſaith,
<hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Here we ſee that thoſe that are thus born of God, cannot wilfully ſin. But he writ not ſo to the Church, to whom he directed this Epiſtle, although they received the ſpecial Anointing. For he ſaith to them in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.24,28.
<hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning, ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son.</hi> And he ſaith in the 28. v. <hi>And now little Children, abide in him, that when he ſhall appear, we may have confidence, and not be aſhamed before him, at his coming.</hi> By which cautions we ſee, that tho they had received the anointings of the Spirit, yet through negligence<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45720:227"/>they might fall off; That ſome are ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen, or otherwiſe termed the very Elect, or as in
<hi>Matt.</hi> 13.8. The good ground the Lord ſpeaketh of, which bringeth forth Fruit, ſo as they cannot wilfully ſin, and therefore cannot fall away, whilſt the other had a ſeaſon of Grace, and the anointing of the Spirit, and renewings of the Holy Ghoſt; in which benefits they muſt uſe their utmoſt diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure; and to perſevere in an holy Life, as they may become the Sons of God. Of which St.
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.29. <hi>If ye know that he is Righteous, ye know that every one that doth Righteouſneſs, is born of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the Righteouſneſs that St. <hi>John</hi> here ſpeaks of, is no other than the uprightneſs of our wills accompanied with our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſevere in an Holy Life; by which we like Children, ſhew forth our Love, and Obedience to God and Chriſt; and if ſo, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us, ſo as we become perfectly Righteous in the ſight of God, through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt put upon us; the which his own words makes ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evident, by reaſon in his firſt Chapter of the ſaid Book he informs them fully how the caſe ſtood with them, where he ſaith in 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6,7,8,9,10. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in Darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45720:228"/>all ſin. If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive ourſelves, and the truth is not in us. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſins, he is faithful, and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>John</hi> in the firſt of theſe verſes tells us, That if we ſay we have fellowſhip with God, and walk in darkneſs, that we are lyars. And he ſaith in the following verſe, If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, that is, as God is in the Light, then have we fellowſhip one with another, that is, with God, according to what he ſaith in the 3 v. of the ſame chap. Now our walking in the light, as he is in the Light, is to have perfection always in our Eyes, and aims, ſo as to make it our daily endeavour to perſevere man Holy Life, and then the Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin. And in the 8. v. he wholly takes us off, of that blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, as to think that we have no ſin. For he ſaith, if we ſay that we have no ſin, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves, and that the truth is not in us. But he lets us underſtand in the following verſe. That if we confeſs our ſins, he is Faithful and Juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. We muſt not here think that this Confeſſion is to be without contrition, and repenting of the evil confeſſed. For if it is, our Confeſſion will avail us nothing; for the Lord will not hear it, to cleanſe us from our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And St.
<hi>John</hi> in his whole Epiſtle makes<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45720:228"/>it evident he had no ſuch meaning, for them to confeſs their ſins, and not amend their lives, as the 4. v. in the 2d. Chapter of the Epiſtle of <hi>John, He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lier, and the truth is not in him.</hi> 5. <hi>But whoſoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in him.</hi> 6. <hi>He that ſaith, he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked.</hi> And he ſaith in 3. c. at 7. and 8. v. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth, is born of God, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, for God is love.</hi> 9. <hi>In this was manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the love of God towards us; becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Love is the great Commandment both of the Old and New Teſtament. And Love is placed in the fore-front of all the Graces, as in
<hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. Where we have in our new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation turned into Charity, which in the old is Love; for Charity will not ſufficiently explain the meaning of the word. Therefore it is ſaid in the 3. v. <hi>Though I beſtow all my Goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> That is, if we have not Love, for Love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without Charity, but Charity may be without Love, for we may be Charitable by the way of Merit, thinking to purchaſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by it, and that will not do. But if we are without Charity in the way of our Duty, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45720:229"/>Love in the fellow feeling of one anothers ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then is not the Love of God in us. For St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith in the 3. chap. 17. v. <hi>But whoſoever hath this world's goods, and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of Compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 18. v. <hi>My little Children, let us not Love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi> And St.
<hi>James</hi> ſaith in the 1.17. <hi>Pure Religion and undefiled before God, and the Father, is this, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the Fatherleſs and Widows in their Afflictions, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi> And he ſaith in the 2. c. 13. v. <hi>For he ſhall have judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and mercy rejoyceth againſt Judgment.</hi> 14. v. <hi>For what doth it profit my brethren, tho a man ſay he hath Faith, and have not Works, can Faith ſave him?</hi> 15. v. <hi>If a Brother or ſiſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily Food.</hi> 16. v. <hi>And one of you ſay unto them, depart in Peace, be you warmed, and filled: Notwithſtanding ye give them not thoſe things which are needful to the Body, what doth it profit?</hi> 17. v. <hi>Even ſo Faith, if it hath not works is dead being alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are not here now to wait for new Calls, but to improve the Talent that God hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, in that we have his word, the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit, and the Checks of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the which Talents well improved, will bring us to Eternal Bleſſedneſs, for if we take to the rule which he hath ſet before us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording thereunto beg his continual Aſſiſtance,<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45720:229"/>God will then never be wanting to us. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That from a Child thou haſt known the Scriptures, which is able to make thee wiſe to Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> By which the Promiſe is obtainable, for as there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Election, of whom it is ſaid their Names was Written in Heaven from the Foundation. So there is a conditional Election, and us a Day of Grace. Therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith having a promiſe of entring into his Reſt, let us fear, leſt we ſhould fall ſhort of it. Therefore let us up and be doing, that thereby we may make our Calling and Election ſure, for we are not of that number that are choſe to be his ſtanding Witneſſes thro' the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may fall away; the which I have clearly proved by the word, where I have ſpoken of Election.</p>

Now if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45720:230"/>of ſin, but the Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs. But if the Spirit of him that raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Jeſus from the Dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the Dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> The which indwelling of his Spirit, is this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm. Now with the Spiritual Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, there is joyned a ſign or Seal, the which is the outward Baptiſm of Waſhing or Plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So as to be buried under the Water; and therefore ſaid, buried with him in Baptiſm; for as Chriſt was underneath the Earth, ſo we ſhould be plunged under the Water; the which doth alſo ſignify to us, that we ſhould be Spiritually Dead to the World, as having no delight in it, or to it. Now the Children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents are ſaid to be Holy; therefore fit to receive this ſign of Baptiſm, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being in Covenant as well as their Parents. And by the Blood of Chriſt it is, that both are made partakers of the Promiſes; but to any that are of Maturity, and not Believers; the which Belief is ſuch, as brings our Wills over into a conformity to the will of God then Chriſt dwells in us by his Spirit, and then are we Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually Baptiſed. And if the outward ſign and Seal is fixt on them, that within them is not ſound the thing ſignified; It is but like a Seal to a blank Bond: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. <hi>For he is not a Jew, which is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the Fleſh.</hi> 29. <hi>But he is a Jew, which is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45720:230"/>and Circumciſion is that of the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Children are innocent, as to any actual Sin; and if they come of believing Parents, are ſaid to be Holy, and ſo fit to be Baptiſed, and the Covenant of God made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was as well made with Children, as with thoſe of Maturity.</p>

And again, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, agree in one; for at our firſt beginning, after God had Created Man, God breathed into him the Breath of Life, and thereby man became a Living Soul: God did not firſt give him a Natural Life, and then breath into him the Breath of Life, ſo as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Living Soul; but it was that Living Soul that quickned his Natural Body, and did intermix it ſelf with the Water and the Blood, as to agree in one, and ſo it runneth through the whole Body of Man; not the leaſt Finger, nor the moſt remote part of man; but the blood hath therein its Circulation: And the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intermixt with the Water and Blood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may ſuppoſe, that the Soul of Man, vvhen diſtinct from the Body, may bear the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Man, for vvhich Opinion, our Lord did no vvay reprove his Diſciples, for thinking he had been a Spirit, vvhen he appeared to them, in his own likeneſs, after he aroſe; but ſaid, Handle me, and ſee, for a ſpirit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as ye ſee me have, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39.

                  <p>IN this Treatiſe is diſcovered thoſe great Truths which we have not underſtood: The which hath much occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned thoſe great and dangerous miſtakes that we are in at this day. But God having compaſſion on them that are unwillingly out of the way, therefore hath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly now brought the true meaning of the word to light, that his juſtice might be magnified; and alſo that man might not bottom on a wrong Foundation, ſo as to think that God from all eternity elected ſome to everlaſting Life, and left all the reſt under a neceſſity of Damnation; For now the places of Scripture that have cauſed our miſtakes as to theſe things, are by the word clearly proved to have no ſuch meaning as we have hitherto apprehended. But this Book being done in haſt, both by the Author and Printer, for which cauſe it was not ſo well done by either as it ſhould have been; For my intentions were, to have had it publiſhed the latter end of the laſt year: But I afterward finding there were ſeveral other things in diſpute in the
<hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which I did not then ſo clearly underſtand, made me deferr it till ſuch time as by prayer, and further ſearch into the word, God might enable me to anſwer them. The which accordingly by Gods aſſiſtance I have now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in a ſmall Treatiſe, or two. Wherein alſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the firſt Churches is more clearly explained. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhewing that their Children were taken into Covenant, and thoſe difficult places (mentioned in the Table of this Book) are here by the word made plain: And Oh! that we would improve the Knowledge of theſe things. And ſince God hath not excluded any from his mercy, that are willing to accept it upon the conditions as it is tendred, let us not by ſin exclude our ſelves, &amp; that we may not exclude our ſelves, is the earneſt prayer of your Servant, &amp; well-wiſher in Chriſt;</p>

10.1. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that entreth not by the door into the Sheepfold, but climbeth up ſome other way, the ſame is a thief and a robber.</hi> And the Lord alſo tells them, that he is the Door, wherein he ſaith, V.9. <hi>I am the Door: By me if any man enter in he ſhall be ſaved.</hi> And it is ſaid <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.

By theſe Scriptures is fully manifeſted, there is no way for the elect to come unto God, but in, and through Chriſt. But by the word, it may be eaſily proved, <pb n="302" facs="tcp:45720:234"/>there is ſeveral ways for the elect to be brought into Chriſt. For firſt, after the fall of
<hi>Adam,</hi> they were to obſerve the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, then declar'd to them by God; and alſo looking to the promis'd Seed for ſatisfaction, and reconciliation, if they were found in their obedience to God. After which
<hi>Moſes</hi> his time, God gave them the Law upon mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> But ſtill they were to look to Chriſt in the promiſe, in that he ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head, and take away the ſting of Death from them. And here God ſaith to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he ſaid to <hi>Cain,</hi>

                     <hi>Behold I ſet before you this day</hi> a bleſſing and a curſe. 27. A bleſſing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you this day.
28. And a curſe, if you will not obey the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord your God,
<hi>but turn aſide out of the way, which I command you this day.</hi> You ſee here was the free Grace of God manifeſted to them above the reſt of the World, in that God had ſo far renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, or inlightned them, as to bring them to the knowledg of himſelf; the which the reſt of the world was almoſt wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. And here God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> a rule by which they ſhould walk, the which it they had ſo done, they had enjoyed the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:45720:234"/>bleſſings that God had there promiſed them, and that He would alſo be their God for ever, and they ſhould be his people.</p>
                  <p>And after Chriſt came, the Goſpel was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, wherein all Nations were invited, that whoſoever would, might come and take of the Waters of Life freely, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.

Which Condition was, Repentance from Dead Works, with Love and Obedience to God, and Chriſt, and thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mercy and benefit purchaſt by Him.</p>

I ſhall here prove to you, that there was neither Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination nor Reprobation, before the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Material Heavens and Earth. And in the firſt place I ſhall prove, there was none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, as I ſhall make appear by the Word and Oath of God. For God ſaith in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.11. <hi>Say unto them, as I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the Deash of the Wicked.</hi> Now had God made a Decree before the Foundation of the Material Heavens and Earth, that the greater part of mankind ſhould be Reprobates, and for being ſo, they ſhould be damned; and

                     </gap> Decree to paſs before they had a being, or the World in which they offended; then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity God muſt have delight in the Death of a ſinner. But God foreſeeing that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and we would be apt to attribute their miſcarriage unto him, therefore by his Oath he confirms to us the contrary, ſwearing by Himſelf, becauſe he could ſwear by no Greater; And in 2 <hi>Eſdras</hi>
8.59. it is ſaid, <hi>For it was not his Will that man ſhould come to nought.</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to God, <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the World do Right?</hi> And how would the Juſtice of God appear to make ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of Souls on purpoſe to damn them, and only in pretence put them in a capacity of Obedience; when his unrevokable Decree was to the contrary? The which be it far from any<pb n="305" facs="tcp:45720:235"/>ſoul to think, it being contrary to his Juſtice and Mercy, and contrary to his Oath and Word. Now as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>They were choſen in him before the Foundation of the World.</hi> The which Foundation admits of ſeveral Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Foundation was the Material Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The People of the World is far oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner termed the World than the Real Earth is: For in <hi>John</hi> 15.18,19. the Lord terms the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the World no leſs than ſix times in two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And ſo by the Prophets and Apoſtles, the People is term'd the World. Now the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World of People has been ſeveral

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mes laid: The Old World in
<hi>Adam,</hi> this World in <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Foundation of the World to come in the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as I ſhall hereafter prove to you, when the Lord brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> at which time he marked them for himſelf, to be the chief Foundation of the World to come; at which foundation the Lord Chriſt was figuratively ſlain in the Paſchal Lamb. As it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8. <hi>The Lamb ſtain from the foundation of the World.</hi> And it is ſaid 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>That Chriſt was foreordain'd before the foundation of the World, but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words admit of a two fold interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in as much as there is ſeveral Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and it may as well be rendered that Chriſt was Ordained at the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:45720:236"/>for mankind, which was before the foundation of that World which is to come, which afterwards the Foundation was laid in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Paſcal Lamb was ſlain, as I ſhall make clear to you. And whereas St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaith, was manifeſt in theſe laſt times, the which is the laſt times of this World of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Bleſſed be God and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Heavenly places in Chriſt;</hi> At which time he ſpake this, it is evident they were not in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore ſpoken for time to come. And whereas he ſaith, in verſe 4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in Love.</hi> Now after
<hi>Iſrael</hi> had fallen off, the Lord tells <hi>Eſdras</hi> in chap. 2. verſe 11. <hi>Their glory alſo will I take to me, and give theſe the everlaſting Tabernacles, which I had prepared for them.</hi> Verſe 12.
<hi>They ſhall have the Tree of Life for an Oyntment of ſweet ſavours, they ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labour nor be weary.</hi> By which it doth ſeem to appear, that God did make choice of others, for the Glorious Tabernacle, before them which were the Foundation.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20,21,22.
<hi>That they are built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-ſtone: In whom all the Building fitly fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord: In whom you alſo are builded together for an<pb n="307" facs="tcp:45720:236"/>habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> Whereas he hete ſpeaks of growing, is to ſhew us, that the building is not yet compleated; which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Building, will be compleated, when the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from Heaven ſhall be revealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. the Lord ſaith, <hi>Him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh will</hi> I <hi>make a pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out; and</hi> I <hi>will write upon him the Name of the City of my God, which is the New Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God, and</hi> I <hi>will write upon him my New Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6,7.
<hi>That God hath raiſed them up together, and made them ſit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus. Now it is certain,</hi> they were not at that time ſet with Chriſt in Heavenly Places; therefore ſpoken for time to come, as his words in the following verſe make out; where he ſaith, verſe 7. That in the Ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of
<hi>his Grace, in his kindneſs towards us, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely declare, that God will ſhew forth the Riches of his Grace in his kindneſs towards them in the Ages to come. Now it is evident that there has not been ſuch exceeding kindneſs ſhewed forth to them in the Ages that are paſt. St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>Chriſt came in the laſt times.</hi> Therefore it is as <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this time it ſhall be ſaid of Jacob, what hath God wrought?</hi> That is, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall again be reſtored, and the Glory of the Saints be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed<pb n="308" facs="tcp:45720:237"/>in that Tabernacle which the Lord ſhall pitch, and not Man. Then it is that the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding riches of his Grace will be manifeſted to thoſe Ages that are now to come. And that is the time when Chriſt again comes, of which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whom he did foreknow them he alſo called;</hi> That then the Lord will call them, of whom he had a foreknowledge of, as by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from the Father.</p>
                  <p>And then it is that will be made good which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of God to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love him, and keep his Commandments to a Thouſand Generations.</hi> Here <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, God will keep Covenant and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a Thouſand Generations with them that love him. And as yet we cannot well reckon up an Hundred Generations from the firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind; for from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt, St. <hi>Luke</hi> reckons up about ſixty Generations. Therefore this keeping Covenant and Mercy, hath its Extent to the other World, which is the New World, or New Earth of people which is to come, in whom, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, will dwell Righteouſneſs; and here, as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath it, will love God, and keep his Commandments; the meaning of which is both one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>And what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith makes it farther clear, that it is when the Lord again comes; at which time he ſaith, verſe 10. the Lord
<hi>will repay them<pb n="309" facs="tcp:45720:237"/>that hate him, to their Face, to deſtroy them; he will not be ſlack to him that hateth him, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him to his Face.</hi> That is, when the Lord cometh, then will be their viſible deſtruction; for he will then repay them to their Face; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.10. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Glory which the then Church ſhould receive at the coming of the Lord, ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 1.12. <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his Glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt.</hi> V. 13.
<hi>In whom ye alſo truſted, after that ye heard the word of Truth, the Goſpel of your Salvation: In whom alſo after that ye believe, ye were ſealed with that Holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if they were Sealed when they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Holy Spirit of Promiſe, then was their Calling and Election confirm'd to them; and this Holy Spirit of Promiſe, was the giving the Holy Ghoſt, the which was alſo for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the firſt Chriſtian Churches, and to confirm the truth of the Goſpel. But he ſaith in v. 14. <hi>The Spirit is the earneſt of their Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, until the Redemption if the purchaſed poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, unto the praiſe of his Glory.</hi> By which we ſee, although the Debt and Purchaſe was paid, yet the Redemption or Purchaſe was not yet in poſſeſſion of him by whom it was purchaſed. And St.
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in c. 2.9,10. <hi>They were a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Generation, or Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar people, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him who hath called you out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into his marvellous light.</hi> V. 10. <hi>Which in<pb n="310" facs="tcp:45720:238"/>time paſt were not a people, but are now the People of God; which had not obtained Mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</hi> The which words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> does make it plainly appear that they were not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before the foundation of this material Earth was laid, for then it could not have been ſaid, they had not received Mercy, if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to it before the Firſt Creation. And therefore the forementioned words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have its reference to the New Heavens and Earth, and the foundation of, that World to come, of which World they are already choſen, to be the Kings and Prieſts of in that Glorious Tabernacle, and to be of the New
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which comes down from Heaven; and then will they reign over that New World, and the Foundation of it is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from whom will ariſe many Generations, and continue for ever; and then as it's ſaid in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>The Kingdom, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe Kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom, and all Dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi> Now, whereas St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in the 2. c. 9. v. <hi>They were a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation.</hi> You may be ſure that they are choſen ſo for time to come; and that this ſpeaking of his, is after the Scripture way of ſpeaking, in that he mentions things that are ſo come, as tho they were already done; and the Saints which are in Heaven, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. ſay,
<hi>Thou haſt made us unto God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:45720:238"/>Here the Saints ſpeak according to our method, in that they neither ſay they did Reign or do Reign on the Earth, but that they ſhall Reign on the Earth, the which will be in the World to come; then are they to be Kings and Prieſts of it, for which they were choſen before the World was, that is now to come; for the ſame Apoſtle tells us,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. <hi>That unto the Angels hath God not put into ſubjection the World to come whereof we ſpeak.</hi> And it is this World to come that he has been inſtructing the Church in. And alſo in <hi>Ephſ.</hi> 1.17. he ſaith to the like effect, in that he ſaith, <hi>The eyes of their underſtanding being inlightned, that ye may know the hope of his call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what is the riches of the Glory of his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Saints.</hi> V.
19. <hi>And what is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of his Power to us ward, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve according to the working of his mighty Power.</hi> V. 20. <hi>Which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the Dead, and ſet him on his own right hand in Heavenly places.</hi> V. 21. <hi>Far above all Principalities, and Powers, and Might, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and every name that is named, not only in this World, but alſo in that which is to come.</hi> Now what can be this world to come? Heaven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to come, which was from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and we all have held the Saints are to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and altho Chriſt was at that time in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet the Apoſtle then ſpeaks of the Power that Chriſt ſhould have in the World to come; by all which we may plainly ſee, that it is that World which is not yet manifeſt; and ſince it <pb n="312" facs="tcp:45720:239"/>is to come, it muſt be here manifeſted; and
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaking of the Glorious Time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.10.
<hi>Say among the Heathen, the Lord Reigneth, the World alſo ſhall be eſtabliſhed, that it ſhall not be moved; He ſhall Judg the People Righteouſly, and Govern the Nations upon Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. ſaith, <hi>Altho their works were finiſhed from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Word.</hi> The queſtion is, whoſe works were theſe that were finiſhed from the Foundation of the World? To which I anſwer, It was thoſe whoſe Carcaſes fell in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe of their unbelief, that they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and would not Fight for that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which God had promiſed them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then choſen for the Foundation of the World to come. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to them in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.9.
<hi>When your Fathers tempted me, proved me, and ſaw my works forty years.</hi> V. 10. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was grieved with that generation, and ſaid, they do always Err in their Heart, and they have not known my ways.</hi> V. 11. <hi>So I ſware in my wrath, they ſhall not enter into my reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, how could the great God ſay he was grieved, if he had determined their Deſtruction before the Material World was; or do we think the Infinite God a deceiver like our Selves? But the Apoſtle in the following verſe, lets the then Church underſtand, they ſtand upon no other terms than <hi>Iſrael</hi> then did. Therefore he bids them in v. 13. <hi>Exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardened through<pb n="313" facs="tcp:45720:239"/>the Deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> V. 14. <hi>For we are made partakers of Chriſt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end.</hi> V. 15. <hi>Which is ſaid to day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Povocation.</hi> By which we ſee that our Promiſes are but conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as
<hi>Iſraels</hi> was; for he here ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Church, in V. 14. Wherein he ſays, we are made partakers of Chriſt; with a
<hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> That they are not ſo in, but that they may be caſt out again. And therefore in his following words, he ſays, if we hold the beginning of our Confidence ſtedfaſt to the end. V. 16. <hi>For ſome when they had heard, did provoke, howbeit, not all that came out of</hi> Egypt
<hi>by</hi> Moſes, V. 17 <hi>But with whom was he grieved forty years, was it not with them that had ſinned, whoſe Carcaſes fell in the Wilderneſs?</hi> V. 18. <hi>And to whom ſware he that they ſhould not enter into his Reſt, but to them that believe not.</hi> V. 19. <hi>So we ſee that they could not enter in, becauſe of unbelief.</hi> Now we ſee they entred not in becauſe of their unbelief; And what was this unbelief? It was in that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not the Lord fully. They did believe that the Lord was the true God, and that he had promiſed them a bleſſing; but they were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves into a War, before they could obtain this bleſſing; but the Enemy appeared too great for them to grapple with. Now the Lord told them, that they ſhould overcome; but they not willing to fight for the Bleſſing, (Their Carcaſes ſell in the Wilderneſs, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:45720:240"/>the Lord's diſpleaſure) So it is with us; we believe there is a God, and Chriſt, and that he hath ſatisfied for ſinners, even for as many as come to God in and through his Name; and this they ſay they believe, and are well pleaſed with it. But when they find it is only ſuch a belief that will ſtand them in ſtead, in which they muſt follow the Lord fully; then they ſhrink at it, and like it not; for they no ſooner ſo believe, but they muſt immediately ingage in a War with the World, the Fleſh and the Devil. And againſt their own Hearts, Thoughts, and inclinations, Will and Affections, or elſe the Promiſed Bleſſing is not to be had. This ſort of belief by no means they like not of, and care not for it; but it is ſo, that if we will not wreſtle for the bleſſing, we muſt fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Condemnation of God, which is Hell Fire. And now in a more eſpecial manner it behoves us to wreſtle for the Bleſſing, now we are at the brink of Eternal Happineſs, or miſery; for when the Lord comes, which coming is juſt at hand, and then we ſhall be judged according to his word; which dreadful ſentence to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> But as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Heb. 4.2.3. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leaſt a a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhout of it.</hi> V. 2. <hi>For unto us was the Goſpel Preached, as well as unto them; but the word Preached did not profit them, not being mixt with Faith in them that heard it.</hi>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:45720:240"/>V. 3. <hi>For we which have believed do enter into reſt.</hi> (In this he ſpeaks of that which is to come, as though it were already done); as he ſaid, <hi>As I have ſworn in my wrath, if they ſhall enter into my Reſt, although their works were finiſhed from the foundation of the World.</hi> As in <hi>Numb.</hi>
14.28,29. Whereas the Lord ſaith unto them, <hi>As truly as I live, ſaith the Lord, as ye have ſpoken in mine ears, ſo will I do to you. Your Carcaſſes ſhall fall in the Wilderneſs, and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from Twenty Years old and upwards, which have murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. Doubtleſs ye ſhall not come into the land concerning which I ſware to make you dwell therein, ſave Caleo the Son of Jephunneh, and Joſhua the Son of Nun. But your little ones which ye ſaid ſhould be a prey, them will I bring in, and they ſhall know the Land which ye have diſpiſed.</hi> But you may ſay, how could God be angry when he had decreed their Works, and ſo concluded them as finiſht from the Foundation of the World.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, It was from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thar World, that then was a laying in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which the Twelve Tribes were then the Foundation of; And not that their Works were finiſhed, or they condemned from the foundation of the Material Heavens and Earth. For in
<hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> 3.17. <hi>And it came to paſs, that when thou led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt his Seed out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>thou broughteſt them to Mount</hi> Sinai. Verſe 18. <hi>And bowing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, thou didſt ſet faſt the Earth, and movedſt the whole World, and madeſt the Deeps to tremble,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:45720:241"/>and troubledſt the men of that age.</hi> That is, the world that is to come was eſtabliſht in the twelve Tribes, which in the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd as the foundation. Which people now being ſcattered throughout the face of the Earth, when they are again gathered at the coming of the Lord, with the Glory that ſhall then be revealed, with the dead that ſhall be raiſed will be the world that is to come, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And of which he ſaith, they were choſen before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world was, which world is yet to come, as I have ſhow'd you. And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel further telleth, 2 <hi>Fſdras</hi> 7.11,12,13,14. (Which Angel by the word appears to be Chriſt.) <hi>He ſaith, becauſe for their ſakes I made the world: And when</hi> Adam <hi>tranſgreſſed my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, then was decreed that now is done.</hi> V. 12. <hi>Then were the entrances of this world made nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, full of ſorrow and travel: They are but few and Evil, full of Perils, and very painful.</hi> V. 13. <hi>For the entrances of the Elder World were wide and ſure, and brought immortal fruit.</hi> V. 14. <hi>If then they that live, labour not to enter theſe ſtrait and vain things, they can never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thoſe that are laid up for them.</hi> We ſee here that the Angel does abſolutely declare to
<hi>Eſdras,</hi> when the decree was paſt, in which the entrance into bleſſedneſs was made ſtrait, or hard to be attain'd, that it was after the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> and that now we muſt labour, or elſe we cannot receive the good that is<pb n="317" facs="tcp:45720:241"/>laid up for us; which ſaying is like that of the Lords, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the World, to try them that dwell upon the Earth.</hi> V. 11. <hi>Behold, I come quickly: Hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown.</hi> V. 12. <hi>Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We here plainly ſee by the words of the Lord, both to
<hi>Eſdras,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> that there is a part required of us, the which is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, that no man take thy Crown. That is as much as to ſay, if thou perform not the condition, another ſhall take thy Crown, which was prepared for thee; for I can raiſe me a People another way; Of which God hath left us ſeveral Examples.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſinned, God would have deſtroyed them, and made of <hi>Moſes</hi> a great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where then would their abſolute Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion have been, for in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. where God ſaith unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the 7th verſe, <hi>Go get thee down, for thy People, which thou broughteſt out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>have corrupted themſelves.</hi> V. 8. <hi>They turned aſide quickly out of the way, which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them: They have made them a Molten Calf, and have Worſhiped it, and have Sacrificed thereunto, and ſaid, theſe be thy Gods, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which have brought thee up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. V. 9. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I have ſeen this People, and behold it is a ſtiff-necked<pb n="318" facs="tcp:45720:242"/>People.</hi> V. 10.
<hi>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them; and I will make of thee a great Nation.</hi> But by
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s earneſt Prayer, the fierce Anger of the Lord was aſſwaged. And therefore in the 14th v. it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the Evil which he thought to do unto his People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe are the Elect and choſen People of God, whom he had Called, Enlightned, and put them into a capacity of Obedience, and made them ſenſible what his Will and Pleaſure was. But they continued not in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but were quickly turn'd aſide; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſaid, they have corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Of which alſo St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, chap. 1.13,14,15. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed.</hi> Verſe 15. <hi>Then when luſt hath conceived, is bringeth forth fin; and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which we may plainly ſee that all Evil proceeds from our own hearts, and the inbred corruption that is within them, being ſtirr'd up thereunto by the ſubtil Inſtigations of the Devil, and by the Traps and Gins, and Snares that he ſtill lays in our way; and the World heedleſly are taken in them. And how many, after they know the Ways of God, yer how few of them do induſtriouſly lay forth themſelves to ſerve
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:45720:242"/>him, as they do, the World, the Fleſh and the Devil,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>But we are his Servants to whom we obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto Righteouſneſs.</hi> And in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. it is ſaid, <hi>Let us come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> The which if we do, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do, God hath promiſed that <hi>he will never leave us, nor ſorſake us,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. wherein he inſtructs us, how to order our Converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, thereby to become partakers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.1,2,3,4,5,6. <hi>Let brotherly love continue.</hi> Verſe 2. <hi>Be not forgetful to entertain ſtrangers; for thereby ſome have entertained An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels unawares.</hi> Verſe 3. <hi>Remember them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer adverſity, as being your ſelves alſo in the body.</hi> Verſe 4.
<hi>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled, but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will Judge.</hi> V. 5. <hi>Let your Converſation be without Coveteouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have, for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> In this latter part of the Verſe he ſpeaks of ſingular Perſons; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith, the Lord will never leave thee; that is, we muſt, each of us ſearch our own Hearts, to know whether we walk in a Reſignation of our wills to his will, and alſo to go out of our ſelves to fetch ſtrength from him. And then it is, he hath promiſed, That he will never leave us, nor forſake us. V. 6.
<hi>So that we may boldly<pb n="320" facs="tcp:45720:243"/>ſay, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me.</hi> That is, every one that doth ſo walk, may ſay particularly for himſelf, That the Lord is my Helper.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> rehearſed the Covenant of the Lord to
<hi>Iſrael</hi> before his Death. Where he ſaith in <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.10.
<hi>If thou ſhalt hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy God to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Statutes, which are written in the Book of the Law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God, with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul.</hi> V. 11. <hi>For this Commandment, which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.</hi> V. 12. <hi>It is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us into Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it.</hi> V. 13. <hi>Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it.</hi> V. 14. <hi>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and thy Heart, that thou maiſt do it.</hi> This you ſee, was ſpoken to the Church that was Elected, Called, and Choſen out of the whole World; and ſo far Renewed and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, as to be put into a Capacity of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſo as they might have done it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith; If they had uſed their Diligence therein, and with Prayer ſought to God for his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; then the Lord, according to his Promiſe, would not have fail'd them, nor forſake them. Now the Heathen had neither the word in their Mouth, nor in their Heart.; and ſome of them<pb n="321" facs="tcp:45720:243"/>muſt have croſſed the Seas if they would have had it. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the 15th v. See, <hi>I have ſet before thee this day Life and Good, Death and Evil.</hi> V. 16.
<hi>In that I command thee this Day to Love the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his Commandments, and his Statutes, and his Judgments, that thou mayeſt live and multiply, and the Lord thy God ſhall bleſs thee in the Land whether thou goeſt to poſſeſs it.</hi> V. 17. <hi>But if thine Heart turn away, ſo that thou wilt not hear, but ſhalt be drawn away, and Worſhip other Gods, and ſerve them.</hi> V. 18. <hi>I denounce unto you this day, that ye ſhall ſurely periſh, and that ye ſhall not prolong your days upon the Land, whither thou paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt over</hi> Jordan, <hi>to go to poſſeſs it.</hi> V. 19. <hi>I call Heaven and Earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet before you Life and Death, a bleſſing and a Curſing, therefore chooſe Life, that both thou and thy Seed may live.</hi> Now this was ſaid to the whole Jewiſh Church that God had brought out of Darkneſs, and given them the knowledg of himſelf and his Law. Upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> abſolutely ſaith, that he hath ſet Life and Death before them, which he could not have ſaid, had their Deſtruction been abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed before the foundation of the Material World was. I do not deny a fore-knowledg in God, that Man mightmiſcarry; but I abſolutely deny that God made a Decree for Mans Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, before ever man was Created, or the World, in which they Tranſgreſſed; but that the Decree was paſſed, according to the ſaying of<pb n="322" facs="tcp:45720:244"/>the Angel, after Man had offended. Neither do I deny, but that ſome particular perſons are ſo choſen, or their Election to be ſuch, ſo as they ſhall not be caſt off. But that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is, That the Jewiſh Church was not ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen or Elected, but that by their ſinning they might be caſt off; For it was but a conditional Covenant that then God made with them: But as to that New Covenant, the which God hath promiſed to make with them, to give them a <hi>New Heart, and a New Spirit, that they ſhould not ſin againſt him, and that they ſhould be all taught of God, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, and that he would never leave them nor forſake them, nor leave them ſo as to forſake him; but then he will rain down Righteouſneſs, and ſhower down bleſſings upon them.</hi>

                  <p>For now the Body of the Chriſtian Church ſtands on no other Conditions than <hi>Iſrael</hi> then did, as to their Calling and Election. That is, they are ſo far renewed, as to be brought into the knowledge of God, and put into a capacity of Obedience, in which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10,11. <hi>We are to uſe all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure. For if ye do theſe things ye ſhall never fall. For ſo an entrance ſhall be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto you abundantly, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi>
2.12,13,15,16. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> And in the next Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> That is, it is ſo far the good will and pleaſure of God, as to call us, renew us, and enlighten us in the knowledg of himſelf, whereby he hath put us into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of working out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling. And he ſaith, in the 15th Verſe, <hi>That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without rebuke, in she midſt of a croc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<pb n="324" facs="tcp:45720:245"/>and perverſe Nation, among whom ye ſhine as Lights in the world.</hi> Verſe

                  <p>Now he knew there was a poſſibility of their miſcarriage, by the Admonition that he gave them; which if they did, it would take away his rejoycing in the Day of Chriſt, in that he had laboured for them in vain. And the ſame Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having your hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and your bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> And here the Apoſtle tells us what is required of us, if we are made partakers of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; The which is, if we find that our hearts are ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our Bodies waſhed with pure Water, the Water of Baptiſm.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas he ſaith, If we ſin wilfully after we have received the Knowledg of the Truth. Here by theſe words you ſee he includes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the then gathered Church that he wrote unto: That if he, or any of them, ſhould ſin wilfully, after they have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, there remains no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment.

And S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith in c. 4.7,8.
<hi>Submit your ſelves therefore to God, reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> And St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſtill incouraging them to hold out, bids them, v. 33. <hi>Call to remembrance the formsr days, in which after they were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of Affliction.</hi> But when God in the Wilderneſs did prove <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they did not ſtand in the day of Tryal. For which, all that was numbred of them, from 20 years old and upwards, that came out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> died in the Wilderneſs, ſave <hi>Caleb</hi> and
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> Num. 23.21. <hi>Now whereas</hi> Balaam <hi>ſaith, God hath not beheld iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither hath he ſeen perverſneſs in</hi> Iſrael. In which words he had reference to the time to come, and ſo ſpeaks in the Scripture way of ſpeaking, and not that thoſe words did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to them at that time: but in the time to come, when God ſhall take away their ſins; For he is of purer Eyes than to behold inipuity, and let it go unpuniſhed. But it is then he ſees no iniquity in
<hi>Jacob,</hi> when he hath removed all<pb n="327" facs="tcp:45720:246"/>iniquity from them, which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do at the time when he again comes. For at that time when they were in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs all thoſe heavy Judgments came upon them, becauſe of their Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>And alſo it is further Evident that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not thoſe words to them that were then left of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For afterward in
<hi>Numb.</hi> 25.3,9. they again ſinned, in committing Whoredom, and Idolatry with <hi>Moab;</hi> as in the 3d. v. <hi>And</hi> Iſrael <hi>joyned himſelf to Baal Peor, and the Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt</hi> Iſrael. <hi>ſo as there dyed for that Tranſgreſſion</hi> 24
<hi>thouſand,</hi> as it is ſaid in the 9th verſe. Now it is farther evident, when <hi>Balaam</hi> was at that time with <hi>Balak,</hi> he ſpeake to him of the ſecond coming of Chriſt, for in <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17,18. He ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not now, I ſhall behold him, but not nigh, there ſhall come a Star out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſhall ſmite the corners of</hi> Moab, <hi>and deſtroy all the Children of</hi> Seth. Which in antient Writings is ſaid to be the Children of eaſe and quiet; and without doubt meant of her, that ſaith, I ſit as a Queen, and am no Widow, nor ſhall ſee no ſorrow; but her deſtruction, at the coming of the Lord, ſhall be at an inſtant ſuddenly; as here it is ſaid, when the Septer ſhall riſe out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Children of

                     <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>what hath God wrought.</hi> That was, then there could be no Enchantment againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor any Divination againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were not committing Sin. But by woful experience we know, that when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had transgreſſed by ſinning, then God ſuffered the Enchantments of the King of
<hi>Babylon</hi> to be ſucceſsful, for to accompliſh his threatned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it is ſaid in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
21.21. <hi>For the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>ſtood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to uſe Divination: He made his Arrows bright, he conſulted with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he looked in the liver,</hi> v. 22. <hi>At his Right-hand was the Divination for</hi> Jeruſalem, by which we ſee this Propheſy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> doth particularly appertain to the time to come, and then there ſhall be no Inchantment againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> for evermore. And the latter part of this Verſe doth make it farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, his meaning was for the time to come, wherein he ſaith, according to this time, which Argues, that there ſhould be another time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what was then, in which it ſhould be ſaid, what hath God wrought?</p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:45720:247"/>Youthfulneſs, and Fornication wherein I over ſhot my ſelf, and defiled the Bed of my Father <hi>Jacob.</hi> For I aſſure you, that the Lord did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrke me, with a ſore Plague in my Flanks, the ſpace of ſeven Months, and I had periſhed if my Father <hi>Jacob</hi> had not Prayed to the Lord for me, becauſe he was minded to have ſlain me. I was thirty years old when I did this evil in the Sight of the Lord; and ſeven Months was I ſick to Death, and with a free heart did I afflict my ſelf ſeven years before the Lord, I drank no Wine nor Strong Drink, no Fleſh came within my Mouth, I taſted not any fine Bread, but I mourned fot my Sin, for it was great, and there ſhall none ſuch be done in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And my Sons hear me, that I may ſhew you what I ſaw concerning the ſeven Spirits of Error in my Repentance. <hi>Belial</hi> giveth ſeven Spirits againſt a Man, which are the Well-Springs of Youthful Works, ſeven Spirits are given a Man in his Creation, whereby all his Works are dore; the firſt is the Spirit of Life, wherewith is Created his Being; The ſecond, Is the Spirit of Seeing, wherewith cometh Luſting; The third, The Spirit of Hearing, wherewith cometh Learning; The fourth, The Spirit of Smelling, wherewith cometh delight, by drawing of the Air, and breathing it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The fifth, I the Spirit of Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Knowledg is made; The ſixth, Is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Taſting, whereof comes the feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things that are to be Eat and Drank, and <pb n="330" facs="tcp:45720:248"/>through them is ingendred ſtrength; The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, Is the Spirit of Seed and Generation, wherewith entereth in the Luſt of Pleaſute. Fot this cauſe it is the laſt of Creation, and the firſt of Youth, becauſe it is full of Ignorance, and Ignorance leadeth the younger ſott, as a blind body, into the Ditch, and as an Ox to the Stall. Amongſt all theſe is the Eight, which is of Sleep, with whom is Created the waſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Nature, and the Image of Death.</p>
                  <p>With theſe Spirits are mingled the Spirit of Error; whereof the firſt is the Spirit of Leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who lieth within the Nature and Senſes of a man. The Second Spirit of unſatiableneſs lieth in the belly: The Third Spirit of Strife lieth in the Liver and in Choler: The Fourth Syirit is of Bravery and Gallantneſs, that the party may ſeem comely by Exceſs: The Fifth is the Spirit of Pride, which maketh a man to mind over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great things, or to think well of himſelf: And the ſixth is the Spirit of Lying, or vain-gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in boaſting a man's ſelf, and in deſire to fill his Talk concerning his own Kindred and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: The Seventh is the Spirit of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righreouſneſs, which ſtirreth up the Affections, that a man ſhould perform the luſtful pleaſures of his heart: for Unrighteouſneſs worketh with all the other Spirits, by taking Guile unto him. Unto all theſe Spirits is matched the Eighth Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the Spirit of ſleep or ſluggiſhneſs in Error and Imagination; and ſo the Souls of Young Folks periſh, becauſe their minds are<pb n="331" facs="tcp:45720:248"/>darkned, and hidden from the Truth, and ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the Law of the Lord, neither o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Doctrine of their Fathers, as befell me in my Youth: But now, my Children, love the Truth, and that ſhall preſeve you. For Fornication is the deſtruction of the Soul, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it from God, becauſe it leadeth the mind and underſtanding into Error. For Whoredom hath undone many men; And although a man be Ancient or Noble, yet doth this make him a Laughing Stock. But <hi>Joſeph,</hi> becauſe he kept himſelf from all Women, and cleanſed his Thoughts from all Fornication, found Favour both before the Lord and Men. Therefore, my Sons, fly Fornication, charge your Wives and Daughters that they trim not their Heads, and will them to chaſten their Looks; for every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that dealeth deceitfully in theſe things is reſerved to the puniſhment of the World to come. That is, to the Sentence of Judgment which will be in the World to come. Now ſince it was Woman that was firſt in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, therefore Women, and Gentlewomen, imploy all your Diligence to eſcape the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Judgment of the World to come.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas <hi>Kuben</hi> ſaith, had not his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Prayers prevailed with God, that God would have killed him. Yhe which, had the Lord then taken him off, where would then have been the Twelve Tribes? To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, God could raiſe up Two Tribes out of One Stock, as there was of
<hi>Joſeph;</hi> or God<pb n="332" facs="tcp:45720:249"/>could have given <hi>Jacob</hi> another Son in his ſtead. For <hi>Ruben</hi> did at time loſe his birthright. <hi>And Eve ſaid when ſhe had born Seth, that God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her another Seed inſtead of Abel, whom Cain ſlew,</hi> Gen. 4.25. And God ſaid unto <hi>Cain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he committed that Murder, <hi>Gon.</hi> 4.7.
<hi>If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doſt not well, ſin lieth at the door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And alſo the reſt of the Patriarchs that was guilty of that ſin againſt <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they at their Death declared what terrible Afflictions they fell under for that ſin of theirs; and the great Repentance they had for it. And <hi>Judah</hi> likewiſe gives an account of his Affliction, and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the ſin that he was overtaken in. And where the Old World is ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>The Lord ſaid, my Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</hi> The which words argue the ſtriving of the Spirit of God with Man, that had not Man been wanting to himſelf, but had uſed his utmoſt endeavour, he might have obtained ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; For although after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Entrances into Life were made ſtrait, yet not ſo ſtrait, but with Labour and Diligence, thro' the promiſed Meſſiah, it was and is attainable. But it is ſaid in the fifth verſe, <hi>God ſaw the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Man was great in the Earth, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord ſaid, I will deſtroy man, whom I have created, from the Face of the<pb n="333" facs="tcp:45720:249"/>Earth, both Man and Beaſt, and the creeping things, and the Fowls of the Air, for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noah found Grace in the Eyes of the Lord. Noah was a juſt man.</hi> Now whereas the Lord doth expreſs, that it repented him that he had made man, and that it grieved him at his heart; the which ſhews a concern in God, that man had not then lived up to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, whereby his Mercy was attainable, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19,20. Now whereas it is ſaid, That
<hi>God is not a man, that he ſhould lie; neither the Son of Man, that he ſhould repent: Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good? I have received Commandment to bleſs, and he hath bleſſed, and I cannot reverſe it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid, that God is not a man, that he ſhould lie, neither the Son of man that he ſhould repent: For man will deceitfully promiſe that he never does intend to perform; or elſe he may promiſe that thing, the which after conſideration, or in time, he may repent of. But it is not ſo with God; for if One Man, or One Generation, through ſinfulneſs, excludes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the promiſed Bleſſing, or Mercy, yet God will make good his Promiſe to another. As for Example, God brought forth all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and promiſed them the Land of <hi>Canan;</hi> but they were to keep his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, in which was included their Obedience, to him. But they, through their own default in being diſobedient; all the Fathers, from 20
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:45720:250"/>years Old and upward, their Carcaſſes fell in the Wilderneſs, ſave <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but the younger ſort, or <hi>Generation,</hi> that came out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to them did God perform his promiſed bleſſing, in bringing them into the Land of <hi>Canan.</hi> Now by the word Promiſe, without Repentance, it doth ſignifie ſomething deſirable to them to whom the Promiſe is made. For when God pronounceth any Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a People, or Nation, it is never ſaid, a promiſed Judgment, but a threatned Judgment; for the Word
<hi>Promiſe</hi> doth ſignifie a kindneſs to them to whom the
<hi>Promiſe</hi> is made. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, <hi>without Repentance,</hi> it ſhews the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Promiſer. And alſo to prove this was only ſpoken in the way of Bleſſing, <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Behold I have received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to bleſs, and he hath bleſſed, and I cannot reverſe it.</hi> But when God threatens a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a Nation or People, it is not ſo: for upon their Repentance, God hath ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.8,9. <hi>It repenteth him of the evil.</hi> And alſo it is ſaid in <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10. <hi>And God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of the evil that he had ſaid that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Now it was not ſo with them before the Flood; for <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher of Righteouſneſs; but they repented not.</p>
                  <p>And it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11,12,13. <hi>God looked upon the earth, and behold it was corrupt. for all fleſh had corrupted his way upon the Earth:</hi> That<pb n="335" facs="tcp:45720:250"/>is, God found them not in the ſtate or condition that he had put them in, but that they had miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably corrupted their way. And it is ſaid in the 11th verſe, <hi>The earth was filled with Violence.</hi> And in the 12th verſe, <hi>God ſaid unto Noah, the end of all fleſh is come before me; for the earth is filled with Violence through them, and behold</hi> I <hi>will deſtroy them with the earth.</hi> That is, the Earth, for that time the Waters were upon it, was deſtroyed. But they were the Earth, or World that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And no doubt, but when they ſaw the <hi>Flood come into all their houſes,</hi> and the Waters like a Sea about them, that they then believed the Words of
<hi>Noah,</hi> and repented; but then it was too late. So when Chriſt cometh, we that have had the knowledge of him, muſt ſtand or fall, as we are found by him. Then it is, they ſhall ſtrive to enter into bleſſedneſs, but ſhall not be able; and the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> alſo ſhall be ſhut out.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Lord ſaith, Luke 13.24,25,26,27,28,29.
<hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able. When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut the door, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord, Lord, open unto us, and he ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are. Then ſhall ye begin to ſay, we have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets. But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know you not whence you are, depart from me, all ye workers of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity. There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of<pb n="336" facs="tcp:45720:251"/>Teeth, when ye ſhall ſee Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and ye your ſelves thruſt out. And they ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down in the Kingdom of God.</hi> What is here ſpoken, hath its particular reference to that time when the Lord riſeth to Judgment. For then the door of Mercy will be ſhut to them, to whom now it is open, if now they refuſe to live an holy Life. But then they will begin to call, Lord, Lord, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us, and he ſhall anſwer, I know you not whence you are, depart from me, all ye workers of Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Here is ſomething very remarkable in the 28. verſe, which I cannot paſs by. That is, when theſe wicked, ſhall ſee
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the prophets in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</p>
                  <p>Theſe that are here ſpoken of, cannot then be in Heaven, as from thence to be thruſt out. Therefore it is at the Reſtitution of all things; when the Kingdoms of this World, is become the Kingdom of our God, and of his Chriſt. Then it is, that theſe wicked, from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be thruſt out. And like to that other ſaying of the Lord, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.41,42. <hi>He ſhall ſend his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and them that do iniquity. And caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Furnace of Fire; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:45720:251"/>Rom. 9.8,9,10,11,12. <hi>That they which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the Promiſe, are counted for the ſeed. For this is the word of Promiſe, at this time will I come, and</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall have a Son. And not only this, but when</hi> Rebecca <hi>alſo had conceived by one, even by our Father</hi> Iſaac. <hi>For the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God, according to the Election might ſtand, not of Works, but of him that calleth. It is ſaid unto her, the Elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> Now theſe two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren God made the repreſentative of the two Worlds. Which is ſo made out by the Lord, both to <hi>Malachy,</hi> and <hi>Eſdras.</hi> And therefore <hi>Jacob</hi> here ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as touching the Promiſed Elect, which ſhall be freely tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in at the coming of the Lord, and ſhall be with the Raiſed Saints, and the reſt of the Elect, the World to come. For it is ſo, that God then will freely chuſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> (by whom is chiefly comprehended the next World) with that free Election, in that he hath promiſed then to give unto them a new Heart, and a new Spirit, that they ſhould not ſin againſt him. But that they ſhould be all Righteous, and inherit the Land for ever. Whilſt he has but to this World ſet open a Door for Repentance, and left Man to do part for himſelf, as to wreſtle for the Bleſſing in endeavouring to make his Calling and Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſure.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid, the Elder ſhall ſerve
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:45720:252"/>the younger, that is, <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Siria,</hi> and others, that are of this Elder World, ſhall ſerve the younger, of which I have given a more full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the foregoing Part. Not only ſo, but the younger ſort of them, whoſe Parents are now Enemies to the Church, yet their Children that has not been guilty, ſhall be ſpared, and not cut off with the reſt of the wicked. For in <hi>Joel</hi> 3. where it ſpeaks of the Judgment of this World, the Lord ſaith in the 8th Verſe. I <hi>will ſell your Sous and Daughters, into the hand of the Children of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they ſhall ſell them to the</hi> Sabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>to a people far off, for the Lord hath ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it; Sheba</hi> being part of the Elect, that will be called in at the coming of the Lord. As it is ſaid in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 60.6.
<hi>And alſo the Lord ſaid,</hi> 2 Eſdras 6.18,19. <hi>to</hi> 28.
<hi>Behold the days come that I will begin to draw nigh, and to viſit them that dwell upon the Earth. And</hi> I <hi>will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to make inquiſition of them, what they be that have hurt unjuſtly with their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when the afflictions of</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. And when the world that ſhall begin to vaniſh away, ſhall be finiſhed, then will I ſhew theſe tokens: The books ſhall be opened before the firmament, and they ſhall ſee altogether. And the Children of a year old ſhall ſpeak with their voic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the women with Child ſhall bring forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Children, of three, or four months old, and they ſhall live and be raiſed up. And ſuddenly ſhall the ſound places appear unſound, the full ſtore-houſes ſhall ſuddenly appear empty. And<pb n="339" facs="tcp:45720:252"/>the Trumpet ſhall give a ſound, which when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man heareth, they ſhall be afraid. At that time ſhall friends fight one againſt another like enemies, and the Earth ſhall ſtand in fear with thoſe that dwell therein, the Springs of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſhall ſtand ſtill, and in three hours they ſhall not run. Whoſoever remaineth from all theſe that I have told thee, ſhall eſcape, and ſee my ſalvation, and the end of your world. And the men that are received ſhall ſee it, who have not taſted Death from their Birth, and the heart of the inhabitants ſhall be changed, and turned into another meaning. For evil ſhall be put out, deceit ſhall be quenched. As for faith it ſhall flouriſh, corruption ſhall be overcome, and the truth which hath been ſo long without fruit ſhall be declared.</hi> Rom. 9.8. This is the Seed which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in. V. 8. Where he ſaith, <hi>the Children of the promiſe are counted for the Seed.</hi> And alſo the Lord by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to underſtand, that the innocent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall not be taken away in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with their parents. And the Lord alſo in. V. 9. of this Chap. ſaith, 2
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 6.9. Eſau <hi>is the end of this world, and</hi> Jacob
<hi>the begining of it that followeth.</hi> Now, as to what the Lord ſaid to
<hi>Rebecca</hi> concerning theſe two brothers, before they had done good, or evil, was no other, then that the Elder ſhould ſerve the younger; for God did not then ſay, that he loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle makes a ſtop, and begins<pb n="340" facs="tcp:45720:253"/>again, wherein he ſaith, in. V. 13. <hi>As it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated.</hi> Which words of the Lord are ſaid in <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.3. After <hi>Eſau</hi> was wicked, and the world with him. But theſe words of the Lord in <hi>Mal.</hi> hath alſo a prophetical refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as to the glorious time to come; in which time
<hi>Jacob</hi> will appear the beloved, and <hi>Eſau</hi> the hated: That is the figurative <hi>Eſau,</hi> by which is ſignified the wicked of the world, but in more eſpecial manner, that <hi>Eſau,</hi> which is Term'd the degenerate root; by reaſon the Lord ſaith, he hath laid his mountains and heritage waſt, for the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of the Wilderneſs. For this curſe is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounc'd to them, that their land ſhall be inhabited with fearful Creatures. And it is the uſual way of the Lord, to ſpeak of things that are to come, as tho they were already done. For when theſe words of the Lord were ſpoken to <hi>Malachy, Eſau</hi> was more flouriſhing then
<hi>Jacob.</hi> For at that time <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had diſpleaſed the Lord, and for his Sins his Mountains were laid waſt, before thoſe of
<hi>Eſau's.</hi> And when thoſe Mountains of <hi>Eſau</hi> were laid waſt, they were not made part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of thoſe Judgments. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> knowing that thoſe words of the Lord in <hi>Malachy,</hi> had reference for the time that is now to come; therefore he here mentions them, as treating of that time alſo. And after he had here rehearſed the word of the Lord, in ſaying,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14,15. Jacob <hi>have I Loved, and</hi> Eſau
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:45720:253"/>
                     <hi>have I hated.</hi> He ſaith in v. 14. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid.</hi> V. 15. <hi>For he ſaith to</hi> Moſes, I <hi>will have mercy on whom</hi> I
<hi>will have mercy, and</hi> I <hi>will have compaſſion on whom</hi> I
<hi>will have compaſſion.</hi> The which words were ſaid to
<hi>Moſes</hi> by the Lord, in the time that the Lord choſe
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſet them above the reſt of the Nations. At which time he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> with ſigns and wonders, to fix them on the midſt of the Earth, for the Exalting of their Glory, and to allure thereby the World, that they might be brought into the Knowledg of God. Of which the Patriarch <hi>Levy</hi> ſaid in his laſt Will and Teſtament: If you ſhould be over-darkned with Error, what ſhall all the Heathen do. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> falling into ſin and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, was caſt off, and the Heathen for a time, taken in in their room. But for the Oaths ſake, God made with their Fathers, they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain taken in, and made partakers of that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bleſſedneſs promiſed to them. And whereas St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 16th verſe. So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy. Theſe words admit of a two ſold meaning. The one is, that we are ſo far fallen, that of our ſelves, we can neither will nor run, but it is God that ſheweth Mercy in calling us, renewing, and inlightning us in the knowledg of himſelf, whereby we are put into a Capacity to will and run. The which, if we ſo do, and continue to do, we ſhall undoubtedly find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;<pb n="342" facs="tcp:45720:254"/>for it is through our own default, if once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, we again fall off? And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth. The which can be no other, than our own corrupt Affections, the ſubtil Inſtigations of <hi>Satan,</hi> or preſſing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Againſt all which we muſt daily go to God by ſervent Prayer, for his ſupport and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and if we ſo do, he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee. But as to what was ſaid here in the 16th verſe, I chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it is ſpoken of the time when the Lord again comes; that then they will be ſeeking and running to enter into Life, but then their willing and running will not be available (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected the offer of Mercy when the door was open to them) for the Mercy will then be diſtributed according to the Election of Grace, which with the Believers is the Promiſed Elect, which will be called in at his coming. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17,18. For the Scripture ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my Power in thee, and that my name might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared throughout all the earth, therefore hath he mercy, on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> Now, as I before told you, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> hath here his reference to the time to come. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes mention, that as the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> was at firſt delivered by Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo will their deliverance again be with Signs and Wonders. The which Signs and Wonders will be before the coming of the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:45720:254"/>Lord, who will be their great deliverer. And therefore what God ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> I will here ſet down, as touching the hardning of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart. The which is in <hi>Exodus</hi> 4.21. Where God ſaith, <hi>I will harden Pharaohs heart, that he ſhall not let the People go.</hi> Not that then God had hardned the heart of
<hi>Phaaaoh,</hi> but that it was then to do, as from the Lord. For his Cruelty to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> proceeded from his own wicked Nature, being ſtirred up thereto by the Devil, who is always an Enemy to the Children of God. And in the fifth chap. it does appear, that God would further prove
<hi>Pharoah,</hi> as touching his Cruelty to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before it is ſaid, he hardned his heart. For in the fifth Chapter of
<hi>Exodus,</hi> ver. 1,2,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. <hi>Moſes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron went in and told Pharoah, Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, let my people go, that they may hold a feaſt unto me in the Wilderneſs.</hi> Verſe 2.
<hi>And Pharoah ſaid, who is the Lord, that</hi> I <hi>ſhould obey his voice to let Iſrael go?</hi> I <hi>know not the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will</hi> I
<hi>let Iſrael go.</hi> Verſe 6. <hi>And Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh commanded the ſame day the Taskmaſters of the people, and their Officers, ſaying,</hi> Verſe 7.
<hi>Ye ſhall no more give the people ſtraw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather ſtraw for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>And the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore, you ſhall lay upon them; you ſhall not diminiſh ought thereof; for they be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, therefore they cry, ſaying, Let us go and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to our God.</hi> Verſe 9. <hi>Let there be more work laid upon the men, that they may labour therein, and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:45720:255"/>let them not regard vain Words.</hi> Verſe 12. <hi>So the people were ſcattered abroad throughout all the Land of Egypt, to gather ſtubble inſtead of ſtraw.</hi> Verſe 13. <hi>And the Taskmaſters haſted them, ſaying, Fullfil your Works, your daily Task, as when there was ſtraw.</hi> Verſe 14. <hi>And the Officers of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, which Pharaohs Taskmaſters had ſet over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fullfilled your Task, both yeſterday and to day, as heretofore.</hi> Verſe 15. <hi>Then the Officers of the children of Iſrael came and cryed to Pharaoh, ſaying, Wherefore dealeſt thou thus with thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi> Verſe 16. <hi>There is no ſtraw given to thy Servants; and they ſay to us, make brick; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>But he ſaid, Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefere ye ſay, let us go, and do ſacrifice to the Lord.</hi> Verſe 18. <hi>Go therefore now and work, for there ſhall no ſtraw be given you, yet ſhall you deliver the Tale if your Bricks.</hi> This hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Cruelty, and inhuman Slavery, was he ſtirred up to, by his own evil Heart, and the Devils, and not by God. For that which God did harden him in, was in his unbelief, by reaſon of his Cruelty, therefore God hardened him in unbelief, that he might accompliſh his fierce Anger upon him, which unbelief was, That he regarded not the Miracles done by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And the Lord is not ſaid to harden him, till the 13th verſe of the 7th chap. For in the 3d verſe of the ſame chap. The Lord again repeateth the words, and ſaith, he will harden<pb n="345" facs="tcp:45720:255"/>him, by which we may plainly ſee that his hardning was not then by his bleſſed Majeſty, for in the
2d verſe of the 7th chap. the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt ſpeak all that I command thee, and</hi> Aaron <hi>thy Brother ſhall ſpeak unto</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah, <hi>that he ſend the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of his Land.</hi> V. 3. <hi>And I will harden</hi> Pharoah's <hi>Heart, and multiply my ſigns and my wonders in the Land of</hi> Egypt. V. 4.
<hi>But</hi> Pharoah <hi>ſhall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon</hi> Egypt, <hi>and bring forth mine Armies, and my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>by great Judgments.</hi> Now in the 10th v. Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>went in unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and they did as the Lord had commanded.</hi> (In ſhewing the ſigns and wonders that he had appointed them.) <hi>And</hi> Aaron <hi>caſt down his Rod before</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Servants, and it became a Serpent.</hi> V. 11. <hi>Then</hi> Pharaoh <hi>alſo called the wiſe Men, and the Sorcerers. Now the Magicians of</hi> Egypt,
<hi>they alſo did in like manner with their inchantments.</hi> V. 12. <hi>For they caſt down every man his Rod, and they became Serpents, but</hi> Aaron's
<hi>Rod ſwallowed up their Rods.</hi> And then it is in the 13th v. <hi>And he hardened</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>Heart, that he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not unto them, as the Lord had ſaid.</hi> V. 14. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, Pharaoh's <hi>Heart is hardned, he refuſeth to let the People go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the firſt time wherein it is ſaid, that God hardned <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart. The which we may plainly ſee, That as to what God hardned him in, was, in his unbelief, that he ſhould not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:45720:256"/>believe the Miracles done by <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron.</hi> And alſo that God did ſuffer the Magicians to go ſo far, was to carry on the Council of God, in that they ſhould be a means to help on the deluſion of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> That theſe Conjurations and Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereto he truſted, ſhould be a means to help forward the accompliſhment of his deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; the which for his ſin and cruelty was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of God for him. For when Man is wicked, God chuſeth his deluſions by that which he is moſt prone unto. As for Example. When God would make good his wordby the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.20,21,22. againſt
<hi>Ahab,</hi> for his Cruelty, and Abominable Idolatry, the Will of God was, That he ſhould be deluded to his Deſtruction, by thoſe Prophets in whom he truſted, for they were the Men that perſwaded him to go up to <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> to Battle, where he was ſlain, and the word of the Lord fulfilled on him.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what God ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the utter Deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> is in the 9th chap. begining at the 13th verſe. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>riſe up early in the morning, and ſtand before</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and ſay unto him, thus ſaith the Lord God of the Hebrews, let my people go, that they may ſerve me.</hi> V. 14. <hi>For</hi> I <hi>will at this time ſend all my Plagues upon thine Heart, and upon thy Servants, and upon thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that thou mayeſt know there is none like me in all the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which words it does appear, that God had not fully determined all the Plagues that he ſent on him, not till that time: For in the 15th<pb n="347" facs="tcp:45720:256"/>verſe God ſays, <hi>Now will</hi> I
<hi>ſtretch out my hand, that</hi> I <hi>may ſmite thee and thy people with peſtilence, and thou ſhalt be cut off from the earth.</hi> Verſe 16.
<hi>And in very deed for that cauſe have</hi> I <hi>raiſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my Name may be declared throughout all the Earth.</hi> Which word, raiſed thee up, in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> is no other than made thee ſtand. The which you may ſee in the Margin of your Bibles. And as to the meaning of the words, making thee ſtand, is, that thou ſhalt ſtand in that place of Power, till my appointed time is come, for the delivery of my people <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing the evil heart that was in him, and that Satan had made him an Inſtrument of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, therefore God hardned him in Unbelief, that he might ſhew forth his Power in him, that thereby the Name of the Lord might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red throughout all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching the Root of <hi>Gall</hi> and
<hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> the which St. <hi>Paul</hi> terms the <hi>Root of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,</hi> and the <hi>man of ſin.</hi> And by St. <hi>John</hi> he is term'd, the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1. <hi>And</hi> I
<hi>ſtood upon the Sand of the Sea, and</hi> I <hi>ſaw a Beaſt riſe up out of the Sea, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the Name of Blaſphemy.</hi> Verſe 2. <hi>And the Beaſt which</hi> I <hi>ſaw was like unto a Leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a Bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lyon, and the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</hi> In the firſt place St.
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, that he ſaw a Beaſt riſe out of the Sea; and the Sea, in Scripture,<pb n="348" facs="tcp:45720:257"/>doth ſignifie the <hi>common people,</hi> from whence this Beaſt did ariſe. The Horns, the Scripture tells us, they are Ten Kings; and here the Crowns on them ſignifie as much; by which Horns the Beaſt is defended, and maintained in his Power. And in that he is like unto a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, which ſeems to ſignifie to us the ſeveral Badges of his Idolatrous Worſhip that he hath ſet up, and therefore appeareth like a ſpotted Leopard. And it is ſaid, he hath Feet like a Bear; that ſeems to ſet forth to us, how he doth trample down the Saints of the moſt High, and tear them in peices. It is ſaid, he hath a mouth like a Lyon; the which, as the Lyon's mouth is the Deſtruction of all that cometh near it, ſo the Mouth of this Beaſt deſtroyeth them that do adhere to it.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the Dragon gave him his Power and Seat, and great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; the which is to let us underſtand that this Power of his, was never given him of God, but that he received it from the Dragon, which is the Devil; who making him a fit inſtrument for himſelf, to carry on his Helliſh deſigns by; therefore he gave him his Power and Seat, great Authority, and put him on a Throne. And the Lord will there keep him ſtanding, that is, make him ſtand that he ſhall not be taken off by any of the Judgments which the Lord doth ſend before his coming. But as God did make that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſtand in his place till his appointed time was come, for the delivery of his People,<pb n="349" facs="tcp:45720:257"/>as chuſing him, to harden in unbelief, that had hardned himſelf in all iniquity and cruelty. And therefore the Lord reſerved him, till himſelf was in the Clouds, before that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Sea: So the Lord again chuſes this Beaſt to harden in unbelief, as to the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſigns that he has, and will ſend on the Earth; becauſe this Beaſt has hardned himſelf in all manner of Cruelty, and Miſchief, and Blaſphemy. Therefore the Lord chuſeth him to ſhew the fierceneſs of his wrath upon, when he comes to judg the World, and deliver <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And then it is, that this Beaſt is taken alive, Rev. 19.20. <hi>And caſt into a lake of Fire burning with Brimſtone, which is the Second Death.</hi> Now whereas it is ſaid, the Lord will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy; The which Mercy will again be Diſtributed to the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Promiſed Elect, when the Lord comes, as it was when God ſaid thoſe words to <hi>Moſes</hi> at the time when he brought them out of the Land of Egypt. <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.18. Moſes
<hi>ſaid, I beſeech thee, ſhew me thy glory.</hi> V. 19. <hi>And he ſaid, I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and I will be gracious, to whom I will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and I will ſhew mercy, to whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> Which mercy was then ſhew'd to the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to their forefathers. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay unto me, why doth he yet find fault, for who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte<pb n="350" facs="tcp:45720:258"/>his will?</hi> V. 20. <hi>Nay, but O Man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God, ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> V. 21. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame Lump, to make one Veſſel unto Honour, and another to Diſhonour?</hi> That is, the Potter hath Power according to his pleaſure, of the ſame Clay, to make a Veſſel unto Honour, and another to diſhonour, but when he maketh a Veſſel to honour out of one and the ſame lump, as he maketh the other, there is more of his labour beſtowed upon it, and more of his proper coſt and charge, or elſe it would be unfit for a Veſſel of Honour. Therefore God ſometimes, to ſhew forth his Power, plucks ſome as a brand out of the burning; and alſo God, of the worſer Clay, can make a Veſſel unto Honour; for God choſe
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to be a Veſſel of Mercy, who was of the ſeed of
<hi>Ham,</hi> which was more Eſtranged from God than the Seed of
<hi>Shem,</hi> or <hi>Japhet</hi> was. And by that Miraculous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentioned in <hi>Daniel</hi> 4.31,32,33. God brought him home by Repentance. And alſo by other great Miracles, God would have brought home the
<hi>Babilonians</hi> by Repentance, but they neglecting the opportunity of Mercy, therefore God ſaid in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.9. <hi>I would have healed Babylon, but ſhe was not healed.</hi> We ſee here was an abſolute Election or Choice that God made of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> and when he was in his Unregenelate Stare, God generally<pb n="351" facs="tcp:45720:258"/>termed him his Servant, which God never did the great King of <hi>Aſſiria.</hi> But as for
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had a Being, he was Propheſied of, that he ſhould be a choſen Servant of God, and alſo, that he ſhould build him a Temple, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.23. But he is no where ſaid to be Choſen before the Foundation of the World.</p>
                  <p>Now as I ſaid before, there is an abſolute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the which the Lord terms the very Elect. And there is a conditional Election, in which we are to labour in, to make our calling and Election ſure. There is alſo an opportunity, or a day of Grace given, the which was offered to thoſe <hi>Babilonians,</hi> as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.9. but it was a prize put into the Hands of Fools. But you may ſay, that their Deſtruction was before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Prophet from God, and therefore they Repented not.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer: God by his all ſeeing Eye, as knowing their Wickedneſs, and foreſeeing their Cruelty to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Upon which the Prophet did from the Lord foretel their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But however, God did offer them Mercy; and if they had embraced the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, God would have defer'd his Judgments to have been Inflicted upon the miſcarriage of their following Generations. As for Example, God ſent the Prophet <hi>Jonah, Jonah</hi> 3.4,5,6,7,8,9. To <hi>Nineveh</hi> to Proclaim the Deſtruction of that great City. But they believing the word of the Lord, and Repenting, God ſtaid off the threatned Judgment, which <hi>Jonah</hi> 
                     <pb n="352" facs="tcp:45720:259"/>proclaimed ſhould be within 40 days, which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their repentance God made it 40 days of years; In which time, moſt of them that was capable of that Repentance, were taken off by Death.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the lump or clay, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> came of, when the Lord maketh a Veſſel of that Clay without any Addition of the renewing of his Spirit, it will prove but a Veſſel of Diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
                  <p>But God ſaith in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>That he made</hi> Iſrael <hi>a choice Vine, and he looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes, and it brought forth wild Grapes. Yet I had planted thee a Noble Vine, an Holy and Right Seed: How then art thou turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a degenerate plant of a ſtrange Vine unto me?</hi> By which we ſee, that God had diſtinguiſhed
<hi>Iſrael</hi> from the reſt of the World, and put them all in a Capacity of Obedience, but they would not uſe their utmoſt endeavour to walk in his ways; therefore he gave them up to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind, and hardneſs of Heart; for they all being put into a Capacity of Obedience, in which had they done their utmoſt endeavour, and alſo lookt to the Promiſed Meſſiah for their Juſtification, they ſhould have obtain'd ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but for want of ſo doing, the generality of them were cut off: However, from among them, God did chuſe part of his Special Elect; the which were Veſſels of Honour; of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>At this preſent time alſo there is a remnant according to the Election of grace.</hi> The which were ſo abſolutely choſen in Chriſt, that they ſhould not fall away. And<pb n="353" facs="tcp:45720:259"/>as to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 9th chap. after he had made mention of the Potter, and the Clay. In the following Verſe, which is the 22d. he ſaith, <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his Power known, endured with much long ſuffering the Veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, God is willing to ſhew his Wrath, and make his Power known on them which he hath endured with much long ſuffering, whilſt they were fitting themſelves for deſtruction, by which way they became the Veſſels of his Wrath.</p>
                  <p>Of whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaith, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2.7. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them which be diſobedient, the ſtone which the Builders diſallowed, the ſame is made the Head of the Corner, and a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a Rock of Offence, even to them which ſtumble at the Word, being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were oppoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But you may ſay, What, were they from the beginning appointed to be diſobedient? To which I anſwer,
<hi>No.</hi> God put them into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Obedience, and required Obedience from them, but they refuſed to obey, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their Neck, and refuſed to return, as almoſt the whole Hiſtory of the Bible gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; therefore God left them to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart, ſo as to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſtumbling-ſtone, to the which diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience they were appointed, becauſe they had been before very ſinful, as in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> we are given<pb n="354" facs="tcp:45720:260"/>an account what the Lord had done for them; And of their Wickedneſs, before the Prophet from the Lord did denounce this Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that he would lay in
<hi>Sion</hi> a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſtone. And therefore, as to what the Lord ſaid he had done for them, and of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariage, before this Judgment was declared againſt them, I will here ſet down as to what God hath done for his Vineyard. As in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.2, &amp;c.. <hi>He fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted it with the choiceſt vine, and built a Tower in the midſt of it, and alſo made a wine-preſs therein, and he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it bronght forth wild grapes.</hi> 3. <hi>And now, O inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and men of</hi> Judah, <hi>Judge I pray you, betwixt me and my Vineyard.</hi> 4.
<hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it, wherefore when</hi> I <hi>looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes.</hi> 5. <hi>Now go to,</hi> I <hi>will tell you what</hi> I <hi>will do to my Vineyard,</hi> I <hi>will take away the hedge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and it ſhall be eaten up, and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be trodden down.</hi> V. 6. <hi>And</hi> I <hi>will lay it waſt, it ſhall not be pruned, nor hedged, but there ſhall come up bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and thorns.</hi> I <hi>will alſo command the Clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</hi> V. 7. <hi>For the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the men of</hi> Judah <hi>is his pleaſant plant, and he looked fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Judgment, and behold oppreſſion, for righteouſneſs and behold a cry.</hi> That
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:45720:260"/>is, God put them in a Capacity of doing Juſtice and Judgment, the which they might have done, but they would not.</p>
                  <p>Now as I before told you, that the ſins of the Natural Seed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Adopted Seed are joyned, ſo alſo the Puniſhment of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed, and of the Adopted Seed are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; for from 11th v. of the 5th chap. to the 16th. v. it doth appear to declare the Puniſhments of the back-ſliding Chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the next verſe ſpeaks of the Lord of Hoſt, being exalted in Judgment; and that then the Lambs ſhould feed together. And in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing part of the Chapter, the ſins of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Seed are intermix'd with them of the Natural Seed: But by the foregoing verſes, that are here ſet down, we are given fully to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand wherefore the Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the which was, in that they did not make a good improvement of the opportunity of Grace put into their Hands, but caſt away the Law of the Lord, and deſpiſed his word, therefore was the Anger of the Lord kindled againſt them. After which it is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13.
<hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> v. 14. <hi>And he ſhall be for a Sanctuary, but for a ſtone of Stumbling, and for a Rock of Offence to both the Houſes of</hi> Jacob <hi>for a gin, and for a ſnare to the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem. V. 15. <hi>And many among them ſhall ſtumble and fall, and be broken, and be ſnared, and be taken.</hi> Here you ſee this<pb n="356" facs="tcp:45720:261"/>Judgment which was mentioned by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> That they were appointed to it, after they had ſinned, that they ſhould ſtumble at that Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Stone, ſo as not to be obedient to him. And it is ſaid in the
16th v. <hi>Bind up the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſeal the Law among my Diſciples.</hi> V. 17. <hi>And</hi> I <hi>will wait upon the Lord that hideth his Face from the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and</hi> I <hi>will look for him.</hi> The which words alſo ſignifies the excluſion of the major part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> with the Powers thereof; for they being moſt guilty of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the reſt. But yet the binding up of the Teſtimony, and the Sealing of the Law among the Diſciples, ſeems that it had a larger extent among them of <hi>Jacob,</hi> than as to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elect that was choſen from amongſt them; For the Lord ſaith in <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.12.
<hi>And from the Days of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt, until now, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffered Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the Violent took it by Force; the which ſhews us for certain, that there were more made partakers of the Kingdom, than thoſe that are ſaid to be the very Elect; for thoſe were ſo Elected, or Choſen, as they could not poſſibly, through miſtake or deceit, miſs of the Kingdom, for Chriſt himſelf ſaith in <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.24. <hi>If it were poſſible, they ſhall deceive the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> by which words it does appear impoſſible to deceive the very Elect. And ſince all the Chriſtian Churches have been deceived, except<pb n="357" facs="tcp:45720:261"/>that of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> according as it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> That all the world wandered after the Beaſt, or great Harlot, with whom the Kings of the Earth have committed Fornication, and who with her Wine, made the Inhabitants of the Earth Drunk; the Churches of <hi>Piedmont</hi> only followed Jeſus Chriſt, and inviolably adhered to his Doctrin, as it is Written of them; ſo as the Valleys had intirely for their Arms, a Toarch inviron'd with thick Darkneſs, with this Motto, <hi>Lux lucet in tenebris,</hi> Light ſhines in Darkneſs; by which it does in a more eſpecial manner appear, that theſe are the very Elect ſpoken of by the Lord, by reaſon that they have ſtood ever ſince the Apoſtles time undeceived by the Beaſt, or falſe Prophets, as the Lord foretold: And by which words of the Lord; it remains alſo that it is impoſſible to deceive the very Elect.</p>
                  <p>Now by theſe words, theſe very Elect are with Violence ſecured from the Evil deceit of this World, and taken for the Kingdom; whilſt the other is ſaid, to take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence; and that is, There was an opportunity of Grace and Mercy put into their Hands, in which they did imploy their utmoſt endeavour to ſecure the Kingdom of Heaven to themſelves; and by ſo doing, they are ſaid to take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence. But unto them that did not ſo, the Lord ſaith in Matt. 23.37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem! thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them<pb n="358" facs="tcp:45720:262"/>which are ſent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord ſpeaketh of the Offers of Grace and Mercy that was tendred to <hi>Iſrael</hi> aforetime by the Prophets, by whom he would have gathered them as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, but they would not: Of which alſo the Lord told <hi>Eſdras,</hi> 2 Eſd. 1. c. 28. to the 32. v.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Lord ſaith in Mat. 13.13. <hi>Therefore ſpake I to them in Parables, becauſe they ſeeing, ſee not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they underſtand.</hi> That is, altho they did ſee and hear, they did not give their minds to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. 14. v. <hi>And in them is fulfilled the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy of</hi> Iſaiah, which ſaith, <hi>By hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive.</hi> 15. <hi>For this Peoples Heart is waxed groſs, and their Ears are dull of Hearing, and their Eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and ſhould underſtand with their Heart, and ſhould be Converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The which Prophecy was ordered by the Lord in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
6.9. after the woful miſcarriage of his people. The which is partly ſet down in the foregoing Chap. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> And after <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been exceeding ſinful, the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſaith in
<hi>Jer.</hi> 13.22. <hi>And if thou ſay in thine heart, wherefore come theſe things upon me?<pb n="359" facs="tcp:45720:262"/>for the greatneſs of thine iniquity, are thy ſkirts diſcover'd, and thy heels made bare.</hi> Whereas it is ſaid, V. 23. <hi>Can the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>change his skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> V. 24. <hi>Therefore will</hi> I <hi>ſcatter them as the ſtubble that paſſeth away by the wind of the Wilderneſs.</hi> Now we ſee, when man wilfully revolteth, and giveth himſelf up to a cuſtome in ſinning, by which he becomes forſaken of God, then for him that has ſo accuſtomed himſelf to do evil, he cannot learn to do well; for in ſo doing, they provoke the Lord to leave them to blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart, and then they are paſt all hope. But the Lord ſaith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 12.19. <hi>For</hi> I <hi>know him, that he will command his Children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice, and Judgment, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham,
<hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> Here by theſe words, it ſhews a foreknowledge in God, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> would command his Children, and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold after him, and they ſhould keep the way of the Lord. That the Lord may bring upon <hi>Abraham</hi> that which he hath ſpoken of him. The which ſhews that the Covenant was but conditional with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, but yet the forekowledge in God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> obedience, and thereupon it became ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to him. And there was a foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in God of <hi>Iſraels</hi> miſcarriage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<pb n="360" facs="tcp:45720:263"/>the miſcarriage of them was foretold, what would hereafter come to paſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. For the Covenant being conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, the breach of the Covenant was their deſtruction; the which default in them, was foreknown of God. But not that God did make a decree that they ſhould ſin, and then for their ſin be caſt off of him, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come accurſed. The which is a very great ſin in us to think, as being againſt the word and Oath of God. And the Lord ſaith, in 2 of <hi>Eſdras</hi> 2.15. To the mother, or Church,
<hi>Embrace thy Children, and make their feet as faſt as pillars. And in</hi> V. 25. <hi>Nouriſh thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, O thou good Nurſe, ſtabliſh their feet.</hi> That is, pray for them, inſtruct them, exhort them, reprove them, rebuke and chaſtiſe them. For the Lord ſaith in the 2 of
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 9.11. They that have loathed my Law, while they had yet liberty. <hi>And when as yet place of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was open unto them, underſtood not, but deſpiſed it.</hi> V. 12. <hi>The ſame muſt know it after death by pain.</hi> And <hi>Eby</hi> for not Chaſtiſing his Sons but onely reproving them, therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Wherefore the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael
<hi>ſaith,</hi> I <hi>ſaid indeed, that thy houſe, and the houſe of thy father ſhould walk before me for ever: but now the Lord ſaith, be it far from me, for them that honour me,</hi> I <hi>will honour, and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> V. 31. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the day is come that</hi> I <hi>will cut off thine<pb n="361" facs="tcp:45720:263"/>arm, and the arm of thy fathers houſe, that there ſhall not be an old man in thine houſe.</hi> Here we ſee, it was ſin, that did diſappoint them of a promiſed bleſſing. And alſo the good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> did forfeit his Temporal promiſed bleſſing, the which was, That he ſhould die in peace. But he unadviſedly went out to Fight with the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd by the ſame King from the Lord to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, as is ſaid in <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27. <hi>Becauſe thine Heart was tender, and thou didſt humble thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, when thou heardeſt his words againſt this place, and againſt the Inhabitants thereof, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt thy ſelf before me, and dideſt rend thy Clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee alſo, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 28. <hi>Behold I will gather thee to thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to the grave in peace, neither ſhall thine Eyes ſee all the Evil, that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.20. It is ſaid, that he went out to Fight againſt the King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> 21. <hi>But he ſent Embaſſadors to him, ſaying, what have I to do with thee, thou King of</hi> Judah, <hi>I come not againſt thee this day, but againſt the Houſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I have war, for God commanded me to make haſt, forbear thee from medling with God, who is with me, that he deſtroy thee not.</hi>
22. <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> Joſiah <hi>would not turn his face from him, but diſguiſed himſelf that he might Fight with him, and hearkned not unto the words of</hi> Necho <hi>from the mouth of God, and came to Fight in the Valley of</hi> Megiddo. 23. <hi>And the Archers ſhot at King</hi> Joſiah, <hi>and the King ſaid to<pb n="362" facs="tcp:45720:264"/>his ſervants, have me away, for I am ſore wounded,</hi> of which he dyed. And alſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in Acts
27.22. ſaith to them that were in the Ship: <hi>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there ſhall be no loſs of any mans Life among you, but of the Ship.</hi> 23. <hi>For there ſtood by me this night the Angel of God whoſe</hi> I <hi>am, and whom I ſerve.</hi> 24. <hi>Saying, fear not Paul, thou muſt be brought before Caeſar, and lo God hath given thee all them that ſail with thee.</hi> 25. <hi>Wherefore Sirs, be of good cheer, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God, that it ſhall be even as it was told me.</hi> Now when the Ship-men were going to make their eſcape out of the Ship, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 31. v. <hi>ſaith to the Centurian, and to the Soldiers, except theſe abide in the Ship, you cannot be ſaved.</hi> Now all theſe things are ſet down for our Inſtruction and Example; and to admoniſh us, that through our own default we may miſs of the Promiſed bleſſing. For we muſt take to the way, and uſe the means, or elſe the bleſſing promiſed is not attainable. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> All theſe things being fair warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>We ſhould uſe all diligence to make our calling and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ſure.</hi> And St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 11.7. <hi>What then?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the Election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi> Wherefore were they blinded? Becauſe they hardned themſelves in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God, as I before ſhewed you. Now there is a threefold hardneſs of Heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:45720:264"/>Firſt, There is a natural hardneſs or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is a wilful hardneſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; that is, when we wilfully harden our ſelves againſt God, and his word. And then it is that God gives them up to a judicial hardneſs of Heart, and blindneſs of mind. Therefore the Lord ſaith in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2. The which place is alſo mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>But to</hi> Iſrael <hi>he ſaith, I have ſpread out my hand all the day unto a rebellious People, which walked in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts.</hi> And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11,8. he ſaith, <hi>According as it is written, God hath given them the Spirit of Slumber, Eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and Ears that they ſhould not hear, unto this day.</hi> That is, as I before ſhewed you in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. The which Judgment was pronounced againſt rhem by reaſon of their great wickedneſs; the which is ſet down in the foregoing chap. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken, and therefore ſhall here paſs it by. But as for the other quotation that is put down in the margin, which is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. The which is not meant by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe that place hath its ſpecial reference to the Chriſtians, by reaſon from the 5. v. downward, it treats of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the World, and <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Enemies; the which is ſaid to be at an inſtant ſuddenly; that is, when the Lord cometh. At which time alſo, there will be a great ſtupidneſs upon the Relapſed Chriſtians, occaſioned by their ſin, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
2 Theſ. 2.10. <hi>Becauſe<pb n="364" facs="tcp:45720:265"/>they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> 11. <hi>And for this cauſe God ſent them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie.</hi> 12.
<hi>That they all might be damned, who believe not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as I before ſhewed, it is ſaid in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. That the Devil gave the Beaſt his Power, of whom came ſtrong Deluſions, ſo as they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lies, Beſides all the other Deluſions that the Devil has ſent abroad in the World; the which God ſuffers to take with them that have no love to the Truth, but have pleaſure in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The which makes ſin exceeding finful. By which we are alſo ſhewn, that the day of Grace, and the day of Life hath not one and the ſame period: That is, that the day of Grace may be taken away, long before our natural Life is Ended: Of which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Wherefore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, to day if you will hear his Voice,</hi> 8. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the wilderneſs.</hi> 9. <hi>When your Fathers tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, proved me, and ſaw my works, forty years.</hi> 10. <hi>Wherefore</hi> I <hi>was grieved, with that generation, and ſaid, they do always err in their Heart, and they have not known my ways.</hi> 11. <hi>So</hi> I <hi>ſware in my wrath they ſhall not enter into my reſt.</hi> By theſe words, we again ſee when it was that the Lord ſware that they ſhould not enter into his reſt. That it was when they ſinned in the Wilderneſs, at which time they provoked him to wrath. Whereof alſo it is ſaid in the 17. v. <hi>But with <pb n="365" facs="tcp:45720:265"/>whom was he grieved forty years? Was it not with them that had ſinned, whoſe carcaſes fell in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> 18. <hi>And to whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not.</hi> By which we may ſee that ſome of them were excluded the Promiſe above thirty years before their Natural Life was ended. And St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>David, Rom.</hi> 11.9. where he ſaith,
<hi>Let their Table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling block, and a recompence unto them.</hi> 10. <hi>Let their Eyes be darkned, that they may not ſee, and how down their back alway.</hi> Now it may be ſaid, wherefore did <hi>David</hi> curſe them? To which I anſwer, <hi>David</hi> was a tipe of Chriſt, and a Prophet, and by the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Spirit he foreſaw the Sufferings of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, and that it would be the Jews, from whom he ſhould receive his Afflictions; and therefore as his own Afflictions, he did expreſs them that were done to the Almighty Lord, which was the reaſon that he thus Curſt thoſe that ſhould be the Afflictors of the Lord Chriſt, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.6,9,28. v. wherein <hi>David</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixes his Sufferings, with thoſe of the Sufferings of Chriſt, wherein it does ſeem in a more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, to ſignify the ſufferings of the Lord Chriſt, and as to what related to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For in the 21. v. he ſaith, <hi>They gave me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me Vinegar to drink,</hi> Which thing was done to the Lord Chriſt, as in
<hi>Mark</hi> 15.23. having before ſpoken of the Sufferings of the Lord, he cloſes<pb n="366" facs="tcp:45720:266"/>with this, which was done to him on the Croſs. After which, <hi>David</hi> proceeds to Curſe them, as is before ſet down. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. <hi>I ſay then, have they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid: But rather through the fall, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealouſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtarts the queſtion, in that he ſaith, <hi>Have they ſtumbled becauſe they ſhould fall?</hi> He fearing leſt they ſhould fall under that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſtake, to which he anſwers himſelf, God forbid; as much as to ſay, it is not ſo, and have a care you think not ſo: And alſo we ſee that the Scripture doth fully make it appear to the contrary, in ſhewing us how they firſt fell. And after which, God ſaid, He would lay in <hi>Sion</hi> a ſtumbling ſtone: So as that, which ſhould have been for their welfare became a Trap. At which ſtone they ſtumbled, as they then miſt of the Salvation purchaſed by him. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.44. <hi>That whoſoever ſhall fall on this ſtone, ſhall be broken, but on whomſoever it ſhall fall, it will grind him to powder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it was the Jews that fell upon the Lord, which was this Stone, but they did it ignorantly through unbelief, and their ignorance was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by their ſinfulneſs, and for want of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to him, when they heard of his coming, the which had they had a longing after him, the extent of his mercy would have been larger amongſt them. But it is ſaid,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 2.23. <hi>When the wiſe men came to inquire, ſaying, where is he that<pb n="367" facs="tcp:45720:266"/>is born King of the Jews? for we have ſeen his Star in the Eaſt, and are come to Worſhip him.</hi> 3. <hi>When</hi> Herod <hi>the King had heard theſe things, he was troubled, and all</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We here ſee that they deſired not the coming of Chriſt: And Chriſt did not manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them. So if we deſire not the coming of the Lord, it is a ſign that we ſhall have no ſhare in him; and to deſire his coming without preparing our Hearts for him, there is no hopes of mercy for us. But as the Jews fell on that ſtone, and ſo were broken to pieces: So when Chriſt again comes, who is this Stone, it is the relapſed Chriſtians that he will fall upon, ſo as to grind them to Powder.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of the wicked, c. 2. v.
11,12. <hi>Whereas Angels, are greater in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and might, bring not a railing accuſation againſt them before the Lord; but theſe as natural brute Beaſts, made to be taken and deſtroyed, ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not, and ſhall utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their own Corruption, and ſhall receive the reward of unrighteouſneſs, as they that counted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to riot in the day time; ſpots they are and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, ſporting themſelves with their own deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> That is, as natural brute beaſts, which are made to be taken and deſtroyed, underſtand not how to give honour neither to God nor man, and ſo theſe ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not, but are ſporting themſelves with their own deceiving. whereby they came to be deſtroyed. And whereas St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith,<pb n="368" facs="tcp:45720:267"/>4. v. <hi>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas he ſaith they were before of old ordained to this Condemnation. That is, there was in old time a decree ordained, that ſuch and the like offenders ſhould fall under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which then was determined for them; but not that there was before Ordain'd of God, that there ſhould be ſuch and the like offenders on purpoſe, becauſe that they ſhould fall under the Condemnation that was of old determined. No, but as our Kings knowing that there will be offenders, therefore make Laws for their puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi>
9.22,23,24. That God <hi>might make known the Riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of mercy, which he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared unto Glory,</hi> 24.
<hi>Even us whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles.</hi> Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That God might make known the Riches of his Glory on the Veſſels of Mercy. By which words we may plainly underſtand, that then the Glory of God was not manifeſted on them. And alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another place ſaith, that they were made the Off-ſcouring of all things. And whereas he ſaith, Veſſels of Mercy, which God had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto Glory. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e he lets us underſtand, that it is God that fits the Saints for Glory. But <pb n="369" facs="tcp:45720:267"/>in the foregoing words of the ſame Chapter, he did not ſay it was God that fitted Man for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And God himſelf ſaith, thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of thy ſelf, O Man. And that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in the death of a ſinner. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith, which he had afore prepared unto Glory; even us whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but alſo of the Gentiles. That was, from their firſt Converſion, the Spirit of the Lord was working with their Spirit, ſo as to make them Veſſels of Mercy, prepared unto Glory; the which Glory will be revealed when the Lord again comes. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith a little before his Death, 2 Tim. 4.6,7,8. <hi>For</hi> I <hi>am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is at hand.</hi> I <hi>have fought a good fight,</hi> I <hi>have finiſhed my courſe,</hi> I <hi>have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here is two things to be conſidered in theſe words; which is, to whom theſe Crowns are to be given; and when they are to be given. He tells us, they ſhall be given to all them that love his appearing; That is, has a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for his appearing. And he alſo tells us, they are to be given in that day in which the Lord appeareth.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Viſion that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 4.1,4,6. In which it is ſaid, The Viſion was for hereafter; at which time, there was a door<pb n="370" facs="tcp:45720:268"/>opened in Heaven. And in the 4. v. it is ſaid, <hi>There was four and twenty ſeats. And upon the ſeats four and twenty Elders ſitting cloathed in white Raiment, and they had on their heads Crowns of Gold. And in the</hi> 6th <hi>v.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>before the Throne, there was a Sea of Glaſs.</hi> By which it does appear, this Viſion which was for time to come, does ſignifie the time when the glorious Tabernacle ſhould deſcend, by reaſon he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there was a door opened in Heaven. And by the meaſure of the City upward, and the glory of it. Which is mentioned in the 21ſt and 22d chapters of the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> it does ſeem that the Heavens will remain open over the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tabernacle, from the Throne, of God. And by the Sea of Glaſs, it doth ſignify as much.</p>
                  <p>At which time it is ſaid, the Elders were Crowned. Which is according to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> Saith, that they ſhall receive their Crowns in that day when the Lord appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, at which time the Glory will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. Now as to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25. Where he mentions what was ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Hoſea. I will call them my people, which were not my people, and her beloved, which was not beloved.</hi> 26. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called the Children of the living God.</hi> By the rehearſal of theſe words, it makes it alſo plainly appear that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eference wholly to the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:45720:268"/>time when the Lord again comes. In that he Saith, where it was ſaid unto them, ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called, the children of the living God. Now, to whom was this ſpoken; it was to
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canan.</hi> Unto which, at the reſtitution, they ſhall be again reſtored. And there ſhall they be called, the children of the living God. As in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Then ſaid God, call his name Loammi; for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God: Yet the number of the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be as the Sand of the</hi> Sea, <hi>which cannot be meaſured nor numbred. And it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, ye are not my people, there it ſhall be ſaid unto them, ye are the Sons of the living God.</hi> 11. <hi>Then ſhall the children of</hi> Judah <hi>and the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be gathered together, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point themſelves one head, and they ſhall come up out of the Land, for great ſhall be the day of</hi> Jezreel. Whereas it is ſaid, they ſhall chooſe themſelves one head, the which will be the head, whom God hath appointed them. And God ſaith in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18,19,20. <hi>And in that day I will make a Covenant for them with the beaſt of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground, and I will break the bow and the ſword, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle out of the Earth, and I will make them lie down ſafely.</hi> 19. <hi>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in Righteouſneſs, and in Judgment, and in loving
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:45720:269"/>kindneſs, and in mercy.</hi> 20. <hi>I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> Which words argue there was a time, in which <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not know the Lord. And the Lord ſaith, 23. V. <hi>And I will ſow her unto me in the Earth, and</hi> I <hi>will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon her, that had not obtained mercy, and</hi> I <hi>will ſay to them which were not my people, thou art my people, and they ſhall ſay thou art my God.</hi> By theſe quotations of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo clearly ſee, that what he ſaid was for the time to come. And he ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28,29. <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> That is, called now, for his purpoſe hereafter for it. 29. V. <hi>For whom he did forknow, he alſo did predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt born among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Now whereas he ſaith, whom he did foreknow, that is, whom Chriſt had the knowledge of in this life, to be conformable to him as was the Apoſtles, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that firſt truſted in Chriſt. They were then choſen, for to be made partakers of the Glory that ſhall be Revealed when the Lord again comes, according to what he ſaith in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For our converſation is in Heaven, from whence alſo we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 21.
<hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:45720:269"/>Now theſe words may comprehend the time that is to come, that they ſhould be conformable to the Image, not only of the mind of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but to the perſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi> intime to come. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Moreover, whom he did Predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, then he alſo Juſtified, and whom he Juſtified them he alſo glorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee, he ſpeaks in the uſual Scripture way of ſpeaking, in that he mentions what is to come, as tho it were already done; For it is Evident that they were not then glorified. By which it does appear, that this calling here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is, when the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and Live, which is at the firſt Reſurrection, which is the Reſurrection of the luſt, at, which time the Promiſed Elect ſhall find mercy.</p>
                  <p>And wheras he ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things.</hi> That is, God will freely give us all things, if we will receive it according to the tender of his Grace in his Word, and with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wait for it, as theſe did. And whereas he ſaith in 33. v. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect, it is God that Juſtifieth.</hi> 33. <hi>Who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died, yea, rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the Right hand of God, who alſo maketh intereſſione for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, as I elſewhere ſaid, that we are no ſooner converted, and brought into an holy<pb n="374" facs="tcp:45720:270"/>Reſignation of our ſelves unto God, but we are accepted of God, through the ſatisfaction made by the Death of Chriſt, who now lives to make interceſſion for ſuch. And as to what we were before we were Converted, thoſe ſins will not be laid to our charge But this is no incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us to ſin and defer Repentance, for thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> never had the knowledg of the truth before. But we are born Children of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church; and if we defer Repentance, and check the good motions of the Spirit, and refuſe to be obedient to the word, thinking it will be time enough hereafter to look after Heaven. In ſo doing, we tempt God to leave us to hardneſs of Heart, and blindneſs of mind, therefore the Apoſtle doth ſo earneſtly exhort the Hebrews, <hi>To day, whilſt it is called to day, not to harden their Hearts:</hi> That is, not to put off Repentance till to morrow. And when we are brought home to Chriſt by Repentance, and reſigning up our ſelves to him, we are then no ſooner in him, but we muſt walk in newneſs of Life: Of which St. <hi>Jude</hi> puts in remembrance, <hi>Jude</hi> 6.7. <hi>Of the Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitations, he hath reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains under darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the Cities about them in like manner, giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange Fleſh, are ſet forth for an Example, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the vengeance of eternal Fire.</hi> By which we ſee, if we give our ſelves a liberty to ſin,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:45720:270"/>God does with hold his reſtraining Grace from us; and ſo through ſin, we become ſubjects of God's wrath.</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35.
<hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt, ſhall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword?</hi> 36. <hi>As it is written for thy ſake, we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter.</hi> 37. <hi>Nay, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerers, through him that lovedus.</hi> 38.
<hi>For I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come.</hi> 39.
<hi>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> By theſe words we ſee that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was of this perſwaſion. That they being once in Chriſt, that it was not any, nor all of theſe forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned things, ſhould be able to ſeparate them from the Love of God through Chriſt: By which we ſee, there is nothing but wilful ſin that can ſeparate the Soul from the Love of God in Chriſt, if once accepted</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
2.13.14. <hi>We are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, Brethren, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto he called you by our Goſpel, to the obtaining of the gloey of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:45720:271"/>Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That God from the beginning choſe the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now were theſe words to be taken, as hitherto we have done, there is a contradiction in the Apoſtles own words. For in the
<hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> he there ſaith, that they were choſen in Chriſt, before the Foundation of the World. And here in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he ſaith, from the beginning. Now were they choſen from the beginning of the material Heavens and Earth, or from the beginning of the firſt world of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which was in the ſeed of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Seth.</hi> Then were they not choſen before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World; but at the foundation of the World; therefore theſe words admit of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction: And from the beginning here ſpoken of, could not reach to God and Eternity; for there is neither beginning nor end; therefore his words here, and in the
<hi>Epheſians,</hi> admit of two meanings. The firſt is, as I before prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, That the Churches that firſt truſted in Chriſt, was made choice of, for the glorious Tabernacle; and ſo will appear to the praiſe of his Glory, as being approv'd of, of God, as to matter of choice or liking in God, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tabernacle, ſooner then <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or before
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> which is the foundation of the world here ſpoken of, as I have already clearly proved. Now whereas he ſaith, that the
<hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were choſen from the begining to Salvation, is no other, then from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the preaching of the Goſpel. The
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:45720:271"/>which begining I ſhall make clear to you by the words of our bleſſed Lord, and St. <hi>John.</hi> Firſt what the Lord ſaith to his Diſciples in <hi>John</hi> 15.27. <hi>And ye ſhall alſo bear witneſs, becauſe ye have been with me from the begining. And St.</hi> John
<hi>ſaith,</hi> 1 John 2.24. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> If <hi>that which ye have heard from the begining, ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</hi> By what is here ſaid it is evident that the Apoſtle had no other meaning then from the begining of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of the Goſpel, by reaſon <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles did expreſs themſelves ſo. And the Apoſtles own words are to the like effect in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5.
<hi>For your fellowſhip in the Goſpel, from the firſt day until now;</hi> which is no other then from the firſt day they heard the word. Now the
<hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> their being choſen to ſalvation, was not ſo abſolute, but that they might through their own neglect, fall ſhort of ſalvation, as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> own words make appear. Becauſe he ſaith in the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Wherefore alſo we pray alwaies for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and the work of faith with power:</hi> By what is here ſaid, it doth appear, that the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> being choſen to ſalvation, was like that of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who was choſen of the Lord for the Land of <hi>Canan;</hi> for God
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:45720:272"/>brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> That was, God by his own out ſtretched arm, brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and through the red <hi>Sea.</hi> This being that which lay not in their power to do. But when he brought them into the Wilderneſs, they were to fight for the Land of <hi>Canan,</hi> or elſe they were never to have it in poſſeſſion. So it was with theſe <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> who were choſen to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for God brought them out of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> darkneſs of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and delivered them out of the red
<hi>Sea</hi> of their ſins, which would have drowned them in perdition, and from which they could no way deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and it was onely the out ſtretched arm of God, that did, or could deliver them, which was done through the ſatisfaction made by the blood, and death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Who dyed for all that will live unto him. Now the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> being thus renewed by the Spirit of Grace, and brought into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God by the preaching of the Goſpel; And delivered from the condemning power of ſin, and accepted in and through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo ſet free in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this world. After which they were to fight for the heavenly Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was the Salvation they were choſen to, or elſe it was not to be had. And God having put us into a Captivity of Obedience, we are to wreſtle for the bleſſing. Therefore St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Phil. 2.12. <hi>Work out your own<pb n="379" facs="tcp:45720:272"/>Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> 13. <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will and do of his own good pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, It is ſo far the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to work in us, as to call us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us by his word, whereby he puts us into a capacity of obedience, in which capacity we muſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1.10. <hi>work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling;</hi> and ſo as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. <hi>We muſt make our calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure:</hi> For if we improve not our Talent that God hath given us, and labour in his ſervice, We muſt expect the ſame ſentence from the Lord, as he had who is mentioned in the Goſpel. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.26,30. <hi>And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, Let us therefore fear, leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his Reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Therefore this Election of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is like that of the <hi>Jewiſh.</hi> The which is as we Elect our Mayors for a <hi>City,</hi> before they are put into the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the place; the which is, if they do not perſiſt in their Obedience to the Supreme Power, they ſhall not come to be Mayor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he were Elected. So is the Election of the <hi>Church</hi> for the Heavenly <hi>City.</hi> The which is, if they do not perſiſt in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, they ſhall not be made partakers of the Promiſe, which is everlaſting Life. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this Grace givers, that I ſhould Preash among the Gentiles, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable<pb n="380" facs="tcp:45720:273"/>Riches of Chriſt.</hi> 1. <hi>And to make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the Miſtery, which from the beginning of the World hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For this Secret was hid from <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the beginning of the firſt World. And alſo from <hi>Noah,</hi> who was the beginning of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond World. And from <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was the beginning of the third World, which is the World that is to come. And ſo all along, this Miſtery was kept ſecret till Chriſt had ſuffered. And he ſaith, 10. v. <hi>To the intent that now unto the Principalities and Powers in Heavenly places might be known by the Churches, the manifold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Whereas he ſaith, principalities and Powers in Heavenly Places. That is, thoſe principalities and powers, which in the Old and New Teſtament are termed the Heavens, are here ſaid to be in Heavenly places; that all of them that are called into the Churches, might know the manifold Wiſdom of God. And he ſaith in the 11. v. <hi>According to the eternal purpoſe which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now take it for granted that God did from all Eternity intend to make man, and alſo had a foreknowledg of Mans miſcarriage; and from thence did ariſe a purpoſe in God to ſave Man through Chriſt; yet from this there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be gathered; that God did then Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Man; but that he had from all Eternity a purpoſe through Chriſt to ſave Man. But the Apoſtles words will not bear this, for he<pb n="381" facs="tcp:45720:273"/>doth not ſay that God had from all eternity a purpoſe in Chriſt, but the word is, according to the eternal purpoſe, as looking forward to the Eternity that lies before us. In which, through Chriſt, there was a purpoſe in God, as to mans Salvation. And according to this St. <hi>Paul</hi> again ſaith, That Chriſt is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him; both which carries one and the ſame meaning with it, for it only reaches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Eternity that lies before us. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.9,10. <hi>Having made known to us the miſteries of his will, according to his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> 10. <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on the Earth, even in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when Chriſt firſt came, it was ſaid, That it was in the laſt times: Here it is ſaid in the fulneſs of times, the which muſt be when the time of this World is fulfilled, that then it will be the fulneſs of times, both of this, and the old World, at which fulneſs of times God will gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on the Earth, which will be when the Lord again comes.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
11.12. <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an Inheritance, being Predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the Counſel of his own will.</hi>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:45720:274"/>Now the queſtion is, what this Predeſtination according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will was, or is. To which St. <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers himſelf in the 12. v. according to what the Angel told
<hi>Eſdras,</hi> That others ſhould have the glorious Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which was prepared for them: According to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That they ſhould be to the praiſe of his Glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt.</hi> By which we may ſee, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in God, as to Predeſtination, was not in the chooſing of every individual perſon, ſo as he could not fall away; but to all that did lay hold on the tender of Grace, according to the conditions as it is Offered of God, through the Redemption purchaſed by Chriſt: Therefore the Apoſtle goes on, as in the 13. v. <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your Salvation, in whom alſo, after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee that this ſealing was after they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and, as I have proved, this ſealing was not ſo abſolute, but that ſome of them might fall off, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, who had the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. The which the words of the Apoſtles make out. But I ſhall here only mention the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> what he ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,5,6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and have taſted of the heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of<pb n="383" facs="tcp:45720:274"/>the world to come, if they ſhall fall away, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them again by repentance, ſeeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe words of the Apoſtle it is fully evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, although they were thus ſealed with the Spirit of Promiſe, which is the Holy Ghoſt; yet it was not impoſſible for them to fall off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And therefore he uſeth all thoſe Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and Exhortations to them, that they might perſevere in Holineſs, and in the fear of the Lord. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> Now theſe words were in a more particular mannet ſpoken of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when the Lord again comes; as in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25,26,27,28,29. where he ſaith, <hi>For I would not, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that you ſhould be ignorant of this myſtery (leſt ye ſhould be wiſe in your own conceits), that blindneſs in part, is happened to Iſrael, until the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles be come in.</hi> 26. <hi>And ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is writteu, there ſhall come out of Sion the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and ſhall turn away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs from Jacob.</hi>
27. <hi>For this is my covenant unto them, when I ſhall take away their ſins.</hi> 28. <hi>As concerning the Goſpel, they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for your ſakes; but as touching the Election, they are beloved for their Fathers ſakes.</hi> 29. <hi>For the Gifts and calling of God are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This blindneſs we ſee happened to
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> not from any Decree in God, before their own default occaſioned it; for the word happened, makes it appear it was not deſigned for them.</note>

                  <p>Now as to what reference the gifts and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God has to us, or chiefly to the firſt Chriſtian Churches, was in giving Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, and in calling the then Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es out of the Darkneſs of
<hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving them all their paſt ſins, and that through the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they were accepted as perfectly righteous in the ſight of God, as it is ſaid, he not imputing their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. And after they, or we are regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſins that are not wilfully committed, are not imputed. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> faith, That if he did that he would not, then it was no more he that did it, but ſin that dwelleth in him. Now the then gifts and callings of God to them and us, did exrend no farther then thus renewing us again, as to ſet them and us upright. Therefore the Apoſtle wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cautions them, and us, that he that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, muſt take heed leſt he fall. But the firſt Churches being thus regenerated, and renewed by the Holy Ghoſt, the Apoſtle might well ſay, that they were choſen to ſalvation, ſince<pb n="385" facs="tcp:45720:275"/>God had put them into ſuch a Capacity, and made them fit for it, if they did not again fall away, the choice being abſolute in God. But becauſe the frail or ſinful nature of man was not removed, therefore there remained a defect in them, and our ſelves, and therefore we are continually to go to God, to beg re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſtrength from him. And if we take to the rules that he hath ſet before us, he will perfect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he work that he hath begun in us, according to the ſaying of the
<hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſa. 84.11. <hi>The Lord will give grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: No good thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> For God doth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from his people on purpoſe to damn them. For the Apoſtle
<hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The Lord is not willing that any ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> The like St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2,3.4. But it may be ſaid, how is it then, that all are not ſaved? The reaſon why, Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.25. There is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of ground. Thereby giving us to underſtand that we are not naturally all alike. For by the words of the Lord it appears that he had done alike for all, (which is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of all) but that we cannot bring forth fruit alike, according to what the Lord ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.18.19. <hi>Hear ye therefore the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Sower.</hi> 19. V. <hi>When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom and underſtandeth not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away<pb n="386" facs="tcp:45720:276"/>that which was Sown in his heart: This is he which received the Seed by the way ſide.</hi> We ſee this ſort of ground, or people, were wanting to themſelves, by reaſon they did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ways to be wiſe. And therefore are deſtroyed for lack of knowledge. And whereas the Lord ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20,21,22,23. <hi>But he that received the Seed in ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy received it, yet hath he not root in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but dureth for a while, for when tribulation, or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended.</hi> Here is great defect in the ground, or Man himſelf. And he ſaith in 22. V. <hi>He alſo that received the Seed among the Thorns, is he that heareth the word: And the cares of the world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Here the diligent husbandman might root out moſt part of theſe Thorns, which makes his ground unfruitful, or his heart bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of faith, and love to God. And the Lord ſaith in. 23. V. <hi>But he that received the Seed into the good ground, is he that heareth the word, and underſtandeth it, which alſo beareth fruit, and bringeth forth ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty, ſome thirty.</hi> By this, we may clearly ſee, it was the ground, which the Lord here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares did differ, for as it is ſaid, the Lord dyed for all, and the promiſes are made to all, that will receive him according to the Tenor of the Goſpel. But we ſee, they cannot all<pb n="387" facs="tcp:45720:276"/>alike receive him. For we read that the ſame Seed was Sown, but the ground could not bear alike; but in that they brought forth no fruit, was becauſe they were wanting to themſelves. But although God may give to ſome more, and to ſome leſs, yet he requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of all an improvement according to what he hath given them. As witneſs to whom he gave the Talents. Now me thinks of all the ground, the ſtony ſeems to be in the worſt condition, being that in which man can be leaſt helpful to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Herein is not comprehended how God doth deal with ſome particular perſons, but to the general carrying on of the Church in the World. Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3,9. <hi>For we have before proved, both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin.</hi>
10. v. <hi>As it is written, there is none Righteous, no not one.</hi> And he faith in Eph. 2.3. <hi>Among whom alſo we all had our converſation in time paſt, in the luſt of the Fleſh fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh, and of the mind, and were by Nature the Children of wrath, even as others.</hi> Tho through ſin both Jews and Gentiles are all of them fallen under the Curſe, and ſo, the wrath of God, yet our natures, are not alike eſtrang'd from God. Now in <hi>Acts</hi> 18.9,10. <hi>Spake the Lord to</hi> Paul <hi>in the night by a Viſion, be not afraid, but ſpeak, and hold not thy peace.</hi> 10. v. <hi>For I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee, to hurt thee, for I have much people in this City.</hi> That is, People, or much
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:45720:277"/>ground, capable to receive Seed, ſo as to bring forth Fruit. And as there is ſeveral ſorts of ground, ſo the Lord tells us there is two ſorts of Seed: But not that God did Reprobate Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the material heavens and Earth to Damnation; but that the Devil hath ſince ſo twiſted himſelf into the Nature of great part of Mankind, that he is, as it were, become one with them. Therefore the Lord put forth, Matt. 13.24. <hi>Another Parable unto them, ſaying, the Kingdom of Heaven is likned unto a Man which ſowed good Seed in his Field.</hi> 25. v. <hi>But while men ſlept, his Enemy came and ſowed tares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the wheat, and went his way.</hi> 26. v. <hi>But when the blade was ſprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the Tares alſo.</hi> 27. v. <hi>So the Servants of the Houſholder came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt not thou ſow good ſeed in thy Field; from whence then hath it Tares?</hi> 28. v. <hi>He ſaid unto them, an enemy hath done this. The Servants ſaid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</hi> 29. v. <hi>But he ſaid, nay, leſt while ye gather up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them.</hi> 30. v.
<hi>Let both grow together until the Harveſt, and in time of Harveſt, I will ſay to the Reapers, gather ye together firſt the Tares, and bind them into bund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</hi> Here is a clear demonſtration, that the Tares are a falſe Seed of the Devils ſowing. And the Lord ſpeaks of them in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.3. <hi>But draw near hither, ye Sons of the Sorcerers, the Seed of the Adulterer, and the Whore.</hi> 4. v. <hi>Againſt whom<pb n="389" facs="tcp:45720:277"/>do ye ſport your ſelves, againſt whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue; are ye not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Tranſgreſſion, a ſeed of Falſhood?</hi> Here we ſee that a falſe Seed comes in much this way, and what is here ſpoken of by the Lord, has a more particular reference to the Chriſtians who are guilty of theſe things, and in eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the <hi>Romans,</hi> by whom all thoſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wickedneſſes are allowed; and that this was ſpoken to the Chriſtians, it doth appear in the foregoing Chapter,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. from the 7. v. to the end, by reaſon God ſpeaketh of the gathering of the out caſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that he then will gather others with them; and it is evident <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath never ſince been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And at that time it is ſaid, That all the Beaſts of the Field, and Forreſt ſhould come to devour. And that could not be to Devour
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> for it is ſaid, they are then to be reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is made farther evident, in that it is ſaid, The Watchmen are all blind, and ſo treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame effect in the next Chapter, as I have ſet down in the 3. and 4. v.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.
<hi>For who maketh thee to differ from another, and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive; now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi> That is, the good ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it receiveth Seed, will bring forth Weeds, as the other doth Thorns, but when the good ground does receive Seed, there is preſently a difference in the growth of the Fruit, in that of<pb n="390" facs="tcp:45720:278"/>the good ground, from that of the Thorny; yet, nothing to be boaſted of, becauſe all that is good in them came from that hand that gave the Seed, or elſe they might for ever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the Children of wrath, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Therefore the lower we ſet in our own Eſtimation, the higher we riſe in God's. Now whereas Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> That is, at firſt God muſt draw the Heart to Chriſt, that the Soul might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that he was the Chriſt. And in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, there was given the Holy Ghoſt to bear witneſs to the World the truth thereof. Neither can any now come to Chriſt, except the Father draw him. And in the viſible Church of Chriſt there is a three-fold drawing of God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By the Invitation of his word, and by way of Reproof, Inſtruction, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is the reproof of the Spirit of God, which we commonly call the checks of Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is the good Motions of the Spirit of God; all theſe being the drawings of God, to bring us home to him through Chriſt, to Repentance. This being the ordinary way of God's Working in his Church: And
<hi>Iſrael</hi> having theſe drawings of God, therefore he calls out to them by his Prophets, for to come to Repentance, becauſe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e had put them in a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:45720:278"/>capacity ſo to do, giving them power to do that part for themſelves; but when through their continual reſiſting the good Spirit of God, and in refuſing to be obedient to his word: And then it is God leaves them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid to them,
<hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, ſo do ye.</hi> And then it is, as it is ſaid, they that are accuſtomed to do evil, cannot learn to do well. That is, when through their own reſiſting, they weary out the good Spirit of God, ſo as he leaves them to themſelves. But whilſt God calls <hi>Iſrael</hi> to come to Repentance, there was a door of Mercy open to them. Therefore God ſaith in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 33.11.
<hi>Say unto them, as I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Here it is evident, by the Word of God, that when he thus invited them, there was a door of Mercy open to them; but when God would not ſhew Mercy to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then doth God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call on them to Repentance, but forbids his Prophets to pray for them, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.16. the Lord ſaid, <hi>Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up Cry nor Prayer for them, neither make interceſſion unto me; for I will not hear thee.</hi> And God alſo ſaith in <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up Cry nor pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for them; for I will not hear them in the time<pb n="392" facs="tcp:45720:279"/>that they cry unto me for their trouble.</hi> By which we ſee, that Repentance will not be accepted at all times. For the Lord alſo ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.12. <hi>When they faſt,</hi> I <hi>will not hear their cry, and when they offer burnt-offerings, and an oblation,</hi> I <hi>will not accept them; but I will conſume them by the Sword, and by the Famine, and by the Peſtilence.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto this people, thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their Feet; therefore the Lord doth not accept of them, he will now remember their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and viſit their ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſee here that the Lord doth not require of them, that which they could not do, but that which they could do, for they might have refrained their Feet, and laid a reſtraint upon themſelves. Therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, where is the Bill of your Mothers Divorce, whom I have put away, or to which of my Creditors is it to whom I have Sold you, behold, for your iniquities have you ſold your ſelves, and for your Tranſgreſſions is your Mother put away.</hi> Here the Lord declareth that he was Married to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but becauſe of their Sins they were put away. And here the Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in deriſion to them: Wherein he ſaith, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which of my Creditors have I ſold you? As much as to ſay, I have kept Covenant with you, but you for your Iniquities have ſold your ſelves. Now had God Reprobated theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the Material Heavens and Earth, to Sin, Death, and Damnation,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:45720:279"/>there is no deceit can be like it, ſeeing God has thus here declared againſt it, and in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by his Oath and word avouched it: But whilſt we were too much poring on the ſayings of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> ſince we no better underſtood them, and too ſlightly paſſing over the Oath and Word of God, and not weighing the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that doth attend a miſtake herein: But our uſual ſaying is, fore-warn'd, fore-arm'd, but we were not ſo wiſe as to take the warning; for St. <hi>Peter</hi> cautions us, that in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, there are ſome things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which ſome wreſt to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, where he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the New Heavens and Earth; of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in ſome places, before the World began; and alſo he ſaith, from the foundation of the World; and again he ſaith, the World to come. Now the words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are theſe in the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13.
<hi>Nevertheleſs we, according to his promiſe, look for New Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi> 14. v. <hi>Wherefore, beloved, ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, that ye may be found of him in Peace, without ſpot and blameleſs.</hi> 15. v. <hi>And account that the long-ſuffering of our Lord is Salvation, even as our beloved Brother</hi> Paul <hi>alſo, according to the wiſdom given unto him, hath written unto you.</hi> 16. v. <hi>As alſo in all his Epiſtles, ſpeaking in them of theſe things, in which are ſome things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures, unto their own deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:45720:280"/>Now St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth make it clear, that in all <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, he did ſpeak to them of theſe things; that is, of the World to come, and of their Election, and Choice for that World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that World began, the which St. <hi>Peter</hi> here terms the New Heavens and Earth. Now whereas he ſaith, That it is they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and are unſtable, that did wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction. And now, tho we have men of Learning, and ſtable in theſe our days, amongſt us: Yet thoſe that firſt brought in this darkneſs, were neither learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor ſtable in the ſchool of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.
<hi>God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the Worlds.</hi> Now what were the Worlds that were made? To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Material Heavens and Earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The world of People that did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from
<hi>Adam,</hi> the which is generally called the old World.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The world of People which did proceed from
<hi>Noah,</hi> of whom we ſprang. And alſo the World to come; the Foundation of which is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as I have already proved; for the Earth is ſaid to be ſet faſt in them. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2
<hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us, with an Holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Chriſt Jeſus, before the<pb n="395" facs="tcp:45720:280"/>World began,</hi> That is, at the firſt Eſtabliſhing of the Goſpel, there was a general call, not of their works, but according to a purpoſe in God, which was given in Chriſt, before the World began, which is the World to come; for in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. he tells, <hi>It is the World to come, of which he ſpeaks.</hi> Now whereas he ſaith in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>But now is made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Aboliſhed Death, and brough life and immortality to light, through the Goſpel.</hi> Now here he ſpeaks in the Scripture way of ſpeaking. In that he ſaith, hath aboliſhed Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light. At which time Death was not Aboliſhed, therefore ſpoken for time to come; which then at the appearing of Chriſt, all the Dead Bodies of the Saints will be raiſed; and his Living Saints ſo chang'd, that there ſhall be no more fear of their falling off, ſo as to taſt Eternal Death: And he tells us how this Life and Immortallity comes to light. That the knowledg of it is through the Goſpel, of which he ſaith, He was made a Miniſter. Now ſeeing Life and immortality comes to light through the Goſpel, we ſhould in all things la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to walk in Obedience thereunto; which Goſpel includes the whole Moral Law: The which is, if we perform the Conditions, we ſhall be made partakers of the Promiſes, which is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and Eternal Life. For now God expecteth Fruit from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, as he did from <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But if there is no other found with us, than
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:45720:281"/>was with them, that is, in ſhew only, we muſt ook to be hewen down, and caſt into the Fire at his coming. Now whereas St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Titus</hi> 1.2. <hi>In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Promiſe, without doubt, was all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long as to
<hi>Adam,</hi> and before the World, which ſprang from him, and ſo to
<hi>Noah.</hi> Before this World was, that ſprang from him. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have his ſpecial reference to the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World to come, which afterward was laid in his Seed. For God ſaith in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.
<hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their Generatione, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.21. <hi>That God hath ſet Chriſt far above all Principality and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not only in this World, but alſo in that which is to come.</hi> And he alſo ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For unto the Angels hath be not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak.</hi> By which we may plainly ſee, that all along what he ſaith, was tending to that World which is to come, and of thoſe that are choſen, and are deſigned to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for that World. Now as to what Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi>
22.14. <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> That is, there is many called, but there are few that have uſed all their diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure; and therefore<pb n="397" facs="tcp:45720:281"/>the Lord will not chuſe them. For although the calling in of the Gentiles was not becauſe of their Works, but according to the Riches of his Grace, they not having had the tender of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But as to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that had before the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, they were excluded from Mercy, becauſe there was not good Works found in them, as God by his Prophets, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith. And as it was with the Jews, ſo it will be much worſe with the Chriſtians when the Lord again comes, if we do not walk in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his revealed Will in his Word, and ſo be found ready. As for Example, by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Lord put forth concerning thoſe that were bid to the Wedding Supper; as in
<hi>Luke</hi> 14.16,17,18,19,20,21. where they all make Excuſes. For they being not willing to forego this preſent World, and to wreſtle for the bleſſing; therefore at his coming they will be excluded his Mercy, in that they ſhall not taſte of his Supper. Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16.6,7. <hi>They were forbidden of the Holy Ghoſt to preach the word in Aſia.</hi> 7. <hi>After they were come to</hi> Myſia, <hi>they aſſayed to go into</hi> Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; <hi>but the Spirit ſuffered them not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now although they were not at that time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go into
<hi>Aſia,</hi> yet God did not withhold the Goſpel from them; for in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. the <hi>Lord biddeth St.</hi> John <hi>write to the ſeven Churches in</hi> Aſia. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith the Goſpel had been Preached to all People, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. Altho they did not alike receive it; for the ground was not<pb n="398" facs="tcp:45720:282"/>in it ſelf alike capable to bear the Seed of God's word, as the Lord in the Parable hath declared it. And alſo when they had received the Seed they could not alike retain it, becauſe ſome of their Natures were more eſtranged from God. And the major part of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> was then Excluded the mercy by Chriſt, by reaſon of their ſin. And alſo it is ſaid, <hi>Nehe.</hi>
13.1,2. <hi>That an Ammonite and a Moabite ſhould not come into the Congregation of God for ever.</hi> 2. v. <hi>Becauſe they met not tha Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>with bread and water, but hired</hi> Balaam
<hi>againſt them, that he ſhould curſe them, howbeit our God turned the Curſe into a Bleſſing.</hi> By which we ſee what was the reaſon God excluded them from his Congregation for ever. The meaning of ever, includes this preſent World; by all which we ſee what was the cauſe, they could not all alike receive Chriſt; which was not, that they were Reprobated before the foundation of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Heavens and Earth. But as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it happened to them, the which was after they had ſinned. And ſo it was with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> after they had ſinned. And alſo the Seed of <hi>Ham</hi> became accurſed: Firſt, from the mockery of his Father: Afterwards from the building of <hi>Babel:</hi> And laſt of all, for their Deſtroying of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Now
<hi>Satan</hi> having twiſted himſelf more into the Natures of theſe, therefore they became more abhorred of God. And alſo this root of gall and wormwood, which the Apoſtle terms, the Root of Bitterneſs: He
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:45720:282"/>alſo brings in a falſe Seed with him, according to the Parable of the Lord, that there would an Enemy come, and ſow Tares with the Wheat, which is the falſe ſeed, which God alſo ſpeaks of in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.3. <hi>But draw near hither, ye Sons of the Sorcerers, the ſeed of the Adulterer and the Whore;</hi> The which is but a Viperous Brood, and a falſe Seed. God ſaith, they are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Children. And in
<hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. <hi>A baſtard ſhall not enter into the Congregation of the Lord, even to the Tenth Generation.</hi> And the Lord alſo ſaith in
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die: The Son ſhall not bear the iniquity of the Father, neither ſhall the Father bear the iniquity of the Son; the righteouſneſs of the Righteous ſhall be upon him; and the wickedneſs of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be upon him.</hi> Now the Baſtard is more begotten in Sin. And the Patriark <hi>Ruben</hi> ſaith in his laſt Teſtament, that Luſt is one of the Spirits of the Devil's giving, and being begot in the breach of the command of God; they are more eſtranged from God, and thereby <hi>Satan</hi> may have a freer entrance into his Heart, as to draw them into the ways of Sin. But if he does ſee all the evil of Sin, and live a very Holy Life, there is hopes of Mercy for him, altho it doth not appear that he ſhall have a part in the firſt Reſurrection. Now the Pope allowing all theſe things, brings in a falſe Seed among them, which by the word is more eſtranged from God; for both Spiritual Adultery, and Bodily Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, are both abhorred of the Lord. Now the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:45720:283"/>old World conſiſted of three ſorts of People.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They that ſprang from <hi>Kain;</hi> for
<hi>Kain</hi> wilfully ſinning, and maliciouſly Murdering his Brother, which was one fall farther from God. then that he was fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> for which he became accurſed of God, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.11. And ſo his Seed became all along more eſtranged from God, he bringing forth a Viperous Brood like himſelf. And from <hi>Seth</hi> ſprang another Seed, which he not falling as <hi>Kain</hi> did, but keeping his ground, in which God had ſet him by the promiſed Chriſt, becauſe he did not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully corrupt himſelf, his Seed was termed the Sons of God, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. And alſo there was other Children proceeded from <hi>Adam,</hi> the which was another Seed, which we do not read of their miſcarriage, whilſt they and the Children of <hi>Seth</hi> did not Marry with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of
<hi>Kain,</hi> which were the twice fallen Children of Man; but then when they did, the Maſs of Mankind became wholly Corrupted; ſo as the imagination of Mans Heart was only evil, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>And God ſaw that the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man was great in the Earth, and that every imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil continually.</hi> Then the Lord ſaid in the 6. v. <hi>It repented him that he had made man on the Earth:</hi> And therefore for Man's ſinfulneſs, God deſtroyed them from off the Earth, only ſaving <hi>Noah,</hi> whom God had found to walk uprightly before him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. And after the Flood, from <hi>Noah</hi>'s three Sons, ſprang three ſeeds; And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:45720:283"/>getting footing into the Heart of <hi>Ham,</hi> ſo as to make a mockery of his Father, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22,25. For which he Curſed him; and ſo his Off-ſpring taking after him, proved a Viperous Brood, and thereby became more eſtranged from God, than the other two Seeds; although afterwards they all, almoſt fell from God; yet ſtill the Race of <hi>Ham</hi> was the worſt, becauſe of their ſecond Fall in their Father <hi>Ham;</hi> and the Prince of darkneſs got farther footing in them; and ſo they became the more forſaken of God. And ſo when God choſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were to drive out the
<hi>Cananites</hi> out of that <hi>Land,</hi> and they were not to make any mixt Marriages with them. But when <hi>Iſrael</hi> did break the Command of God by their mixt Marriages with them, contrary to the command of God, they were drawn away by them to their Abominations. And when <hi>Iſrael</hi> became guilty of the like ſins, they alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came forſaken of God. Now we ſee that theſe two Worlds had each of them three <hi>Seeds.</hi>

<hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in part is happened to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in. And ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, there ſhall come out of</hi> Sion <hi>the Deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlinſs from</hi> Jacob. And then it doth appear the mercy ſhall return to the Seed of <hi>Shem.</hi> As to thoſe Heathen Nations, which are the Promiſed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, ſpoken of in <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> And the third Seed will be the young Children of the Wicked<pb n="402" facs="tcp:45720:284"/>Brood, which ſhall be left to remain, as in <hi>Joel</hi> 3.8. where I have already ſhewed you, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall then ſell them for Servants.</p>
                  <p>This being clear by the word of God. And <hi>Noah</hi> in his Bleſſing and Curſing his Children, had his reference to the World to come, and not to this preſent time, for it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.24.
<hi>And</hi> Noah <hi>awoke from his Wine, and knew what his younger Son did unto him.</hi> 25. v. <hi>And he ſaid, curſed be</hi> Canaan, <hi>a Servant to Servants ſhall he be unto his Brethren.</hi> 26. v. <hi>And he ſaid, bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>ſhall be his Servant.</hi> 27. v. <hi>God ſhall enlarge</hi> Japhet, <hi>and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem, <hi>and</hi> Canaan <hi>ſhall be his Servant.</hi>

                  <p>Now the Hiſtory of the Bible makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that all along the Seed of <hi>Ham</hi> was thoſe that bore the greater ſway, and was the moſt flouriſhing People, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. And ſo on to

At laſt they were the People that deſtroyed <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and therefore were not ſervant of Servants to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> only thoſe few that were taken off in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whilſt the reſt remained Lords of the World, till
<hi>Cyrus</hi> his time. And in the Propheſy of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by the
<hi>Medes.</hi> The Lord there terms them to be the Heavens and Earth; which Heavens the Lord ſaid he would ſhake, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Earth out of her place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.13. to 17 v. The which was when the Earth of that People was removed out of their place, which<pb n="403" facs="tcp:45720:284"/>Earth was the People: And afterward they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſcattered People. Now neither the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> did come of the Loyns of the foregoing Kings of their <hi>Country;</hi> And by the Propheſy of <hi>Noah,</hi> they are ſome of the ſtock of that old Root <hi>Ham;</hi> for their Prieſts, Friers, Monks, Jeſuits, Cardinals and Popes, are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from among all the World. And the Prince of Darkneſs knew where to raiſe part of his old ſtock to play a new game with.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo appears to be one of the ſame Race. And by theſe Two Satan hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted almoſt the whole Chriſtian World. But the wonderful Subtilty of the Devil, was in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the Followers of that Falſe Prophet and Impoſtor, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to Morality. Whilſt the pretended Vicar, which the Devil ſet up for the Vicar of Chriſt, gave liberty to all manner of Wickedneſs, which either Man or Devil could invent, either by his Licenſes, Pardons, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, if money were in the caſe. And the Devil knowing that Chriſt was to come, but not knowing that he was to come to ſuffer, therefore ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.29, <hi>Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</hi> By theſe words it is clear, the Devils knew that the Lord was to come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, but that it was then before his time; and they receiving not their torment then, they know that he is to come again. But the Devil has cauſed the Pope and his Adherents to deny it, which is the Reaſon we have all been ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in Darkneſs, coming out of the dregs of<pb n="404" facs="tcp:45720:285"/>Popery. And the Prince of Darkneſs cauſing <hi>Mahomet</hi> to tell the people, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the more to take us off from the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the coming of the Lord, by the falſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors pretending thereunto, and by the Pope's denying of it. For the Devil carrieth on his Kingdom by a Myſtery in iniquity. And now when the Lord cometh, the Children of theſe forementioned will not be taken away with their wicked Parents; but will, as I have elſewhere ſhewed you, then be ſaved to be ſold for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to thoſe Nations that are ſaid by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.8. ſhall be Servants to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And then will the bleſſing and curſing of
<hi>Noah</hi> be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled concerning his Sons. When this <hi>Ham</hi> is become ſervant of ſervants, then alſo ſhall thoſe of <hi>Japhet,</hi> which are found in Chriſt, dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem;</hi> and ſo be made partakers of the promiſed New Covenant with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whilſt ſome others of the Heathen Gentiles are ſpared to ſee the Glory, and partake of the Mercy; but the great Mercy will then return on that Race that
<hi>Abraham</hi> came of; for <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> are then taken into Covenant, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Iſrael</hi> for Daughters, though not by the ſame Covenant. Now there being theſe Three Seeds, part of them, left again for the other World, with ſome of the Gentile Race, of whom comes
<hi>Meſheth</hi> and <hi>Tubal,</hi> and it is theſe will prove the <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil again is looſed; and the Glory of the Lord not ſo viſible amongſt them. Then he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:45720:285"/>them, and what others he can deceive with them, to go up and plunder <hi>Jer uſalem</hi> of the wonderful Riches that then will be there; for which Attempt every one that will be in the Conſpiracy, ſhall be utterly cut off; as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.12. <hi>And this ſhall be the Plague wherewith the Lord will ſmite all the people that have fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeruſalem: Their Fleſh ſhall conſume away while they ſtand upon their feet, and their eyes ſhall conſume away in their holes, and their tongue ſhall conſume away in their mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of certain this is the Battle that is to be fought after Satan is looſed; for it is after Chriſt appears upon Mount <hi>Olivet;</hi> after the Mountain cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt, for a Receptacle for them that are ſaved, whilſt the Earth is renewing, after the wicked are deſtroyed, and after <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain built. After which it is ſaid in the
11th verſe, <hi>There ſhall be no more utter deſtruction, but Jeruſalem ſhall be ſafely inhabited, becauſe</hi> none ſhall make any attempt againſt them till after the Thouſand Years. After which, <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> whom the Devil will gather together, will come up againſt
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom God will deſtroy; as in the 38th Chapter of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9,10. and them that eſcape the Fire and Hail that comes from Heaven, ſhall pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in
<hi>Zachariah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now having fully proved how ſome became to be more eſtranged from God than other ſome, the which was as <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that it hapned to them; ſo may it be ſaid of theſe,<pb n="406" facs="tcp:45720:286"/>that it hapned unto them; firſt, through the ſubtle Inſinuations of the Devil to them, and ſecondly, by their own willful miſcarriage, when they were again reſtored to mercy by Chriſt, and again renewed in him.</p>
                  <p>And in that <hi>Iſrael</hi> will have the preheminence, it alſo was through the Faithfulneſs of <hi>Abraham</hi> in his ſervice, and in the patient waiting for his promiſe, after the Lord had choſen him. And alſo in that <hi>Abraham</hi> did offer up his Only <hi>Son Iſaac;</hi> for the doing of which, the Lord did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his promiſed bleſſing to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> which was, That in him and his <hi>Seed,</hi> all the Families of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. And had
<hi>Iſrael</hi> walked in the ſteps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Capacity God had put them in, their Kingdom had never been deſtroyed,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.18,19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.5. But God foreſeeing they would be wanting to themſelves, in not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Covenant, therefore their deſtruction was foretold by the Prophets. And alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>David</hi> patiently waited upon the Lord till it was his time to bring him to the Kingdom, bearing all his Afflictions till it was the Lord's time to bring him out of them. And when he was on the Throne he perſiſted in his deſire of Advancing the Glory of the Lord, therefore God made that great Promiſe to him and his ſeed, as in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. Now God likewiſe choſe <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> to be Kings; but they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to his Commands, therefore they were Accurſed of him. And alſo they that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for God in well doing, ſhall in time to come
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:45720:286"/>receive the greater Glory, as thoſe that have been moſt wicked, ſhall receive the greater Puniſhment</p>
                  <p>And whereas God ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the Righteous, that he ſhall ſurely Live: If he truſt to his own Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity, all his Righteouſneſs ſhall not be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but for his iniquity that he hath committed he ſhall die for it.</hi> Now God here ſaith, when he ſhall ſay to the Righteous, That he ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live, yet if he upon the promiſe of God for Life, and for his paſt Obedience, does take a Liberty to do iniquity, his paſt Righteouſneſs ſhall not be remembred, but for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity he ſhall die. And ſo is our Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Elections to Life and Salvation that are abſolutely promiſed to us by God. Yet if we are wanting to our ſelves, they prove of no effect to us. And the caſe ſtands ſo with the wicked. For the Lord ſaith in the 14. v. <hi>Again, when I ſay unto the wicked, thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die: If he turn from his ſin, and do that which is Lawful and Right.</hi> 15. v. <hi>If the wicked reſtore the Pledg, give again that he hath robbed, walk in Statutes of Life without committing iniquity; he ſhall ſurely Live, he ſhall not die.</hi> That is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wilfully committing iniquity. By this we alſo ſee, that if God doth ſay to the wicked, Thou ſhalt ſurely die: Yet that threatning was not of force, no longer than the Man remained ſinful; of which the Lord, in <hi>Jer.</hi>
36.3. <hi>It may be that the Houſe of Judah will hear all the Evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they may<pb n="408" facs="tcp:45720:287"/>return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity, and their ſin.</hi> And alſo the Lord ſaith in <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. from the 3. to the 9. v.</p>
                  <p>But as for thoſe ſinners, who by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued cuſtom in ſin, God has left to hardneſs of Heart, and blindneſs of mind, they cannot come to amendment of Life. And God ſaith in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. to the 31. v. <hi>But if the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> 23. <hi>Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhall die, ſaith the Lord God, and not that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his ways and live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now while the Lord calls to a ſinner to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, there is power in the ſinner to turn from his ways, and to ſeek to God that he may live. 25. v. Yet ye ſay the way of the Lord is not equal, <hi>Here now, O Houſe of Iſrael,, is not my way equal, are not your ways unequal?</hi> 30. v. <hi>Therefore I will judg you, O Houſe of Iſrael, every one according to his ways, ſaith the Lord God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and turn your ſelves from all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruin.</hi> 33. v.
<hi>Caſt away from you all your Trangreſſions, whereby ye have Tranſgreſſed, and make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> 32. v. <hi>For I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord, wherefore turn your ſelves and live ye.</hi> Now whilſt God calls to a People to come to Repentance, there is a door open to them for Mercy, and then they are not<pb n="409" facs="tcp:45720:287"/>left of God to hardneſs of Heart, and blind neſs of mind; ſo as if they do but uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence in indeavouring to forſake their ſins, and go to God by Prayer, they ſhall not want his aſſiſtance. Now whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28.
<hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more,</hi> So for all other ſins, there remains a power in us to withſtand and make reſiſtance againſt, till ſuch time, that through the often refuſing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his word, and reſiſting the good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Spirit, God leaves them to hardneſs of Heart, and blindneſs of Mind. Now whilſt the door of Mercy is open, we may caſt away all our Tranſgreſſions. That is, take up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions againſt them; and continually beg of God for his Aſſiſtance in our Performance. And <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. cry out with the Church, <hi>Lord draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> God hath left us a ſure rule, if we will take to the means; therefore let us walk in the ways of God; and keep to our conſtant duty in Praying, and we ſhall never be forſaken of him: For the new Heart and the new Spirit which God requireth we ſhould make us, is, that they ſhould deſire Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, as they did heretofore ſin and wickedneſs; and alſo to uſe their utmoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence for attaining unto an Holy Life, deſiring God's Aſſiſtance; for he will never leave us nor forſake us if we ſo do; for God withdraws not the good motions of his Spirit from any of his People, till ſuch time as they fall away from him. And this new Heart, and new Spirit, in<pb n="410" facs="tcp:45720:288"/>the Capacity he hath put us, and by the means ſet before us, we are able to make us by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed aſſiſtance; but this is not the <hi>new heart</hi> which he hath promiſed to give, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. By which we may ſee it is our ſlothfulneſs and ſlugiſhneſs; and alſo in our giving way to Temptations, and to our own inclinations, and affections, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Satan, for our want of bridling them, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Soul which way he pleaſeth; and ſo for want of watchfulneſs, diligence and labour in the ſervice of the Lord: They loſe the promiſed bleſſing which is Eternal Life, and ſo come to have their Portion in Hell it ſelf; but if we are found in the ways of God, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, God doth not forget our Work and Labour of Love. And twice in this foregoing Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> God ſaith,
<hi>I have no pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after the fall of Man, the decree was, that the entrances into life, ſhould be made ſtrait, ſo as thoſe that will not wreſtle for the bleſſing cannot have it. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.13. <hi>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> That is, <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore God left them to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, and ſo concluding them all in unbelief, that is, the greater part of them, that they might taſte the fruit of their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the weight of his diſpleaſure, and that afterward he might make ſome of all, ſharers of his mercy. And the Lord ſaith in <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the people<pb n="411" facs="tcp:45720:288"/>not afraid? Shall there be evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> This is ſpoken of the Evil of Puniſhment, as all the Chapter makes appear. For as man is the committer of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ſin, ſo God is the inflictor of the Evil of puniſhment. And alſo the like is ſaid in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 42.24.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, in
<hi>Acts</hi> 2.23,24. <hi>Him, being delivered by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Counſel and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain. Whom God hath raiſed up, having looſed the pains of Death; becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it.</hi> This being moſt certain, that the Jews could have had no power to crucifie the Lord of Life, had it not been done by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Counſel and Foreknowledge of God. But by theſe words, there is not one ſyllable from whence we may gather, that this Counſel was before the material Heavens and Earth; but rather the contrary, in that he mentions them not. And as to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27,28. <hi>For of a truth, againſt thy Holy Child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſrael, were gathered together.</hi> 28. <hi>For to do whatſoever thy Hand and thy Counſel determined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now God eclipſing the Glory of Chriſt, and Chriſt taking upon him the Form of a Servant, and he ſpeaking againſt their Wicked Ways, the which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not bear, and thereupon <pb n="412" facs="tcp:45720:289"/>Satan made them his Inſtruments to accompliſh his Helliſh Deſign; by which he thought to have conquered the Lord of Life; but he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wrought his own eternal perdition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the determined Counfel of God was brought to paſs, in Satan's Overthrow, and man's ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is ſaid by the Angel, where he mentions the Beaſt and the Kings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.17. <hi>For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their Kingdom unto the Beaſt, until the words of God ſhall be fullfilled.</hi> Now we may ſay, Wherefore was it the Will of God, to put in the Hearts of theſe Kings to agree in giving their Power to the Beaſt, until his Word ſhould be fullfilled. The Reaſon is this: There was a Foreknowledge in God of their miſcarriage. And upon that foreknowledg of their miſcarriage, God did determine to leave them to deluſion, till ſuch time his Words ſhould be fullfilled; according to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
2.9,10. where he ſpeaks of the Beaſt, <hi>Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, with all Power, and Signs, and Lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> 10. v. <hi>And with all deceivableneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, in them that periſh, becauſe they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> We ſee this was ſo determined of God, by reaſon God foreſeeing they would have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Ways, nor receive the Truth in the Love thereof. Therefore they were given up by God, to follow the del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:45720:289"/>Now whereas it is ſaid, in
<hi>Acts</hi> 13.46,47,48. <hi>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and ſaid, it was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judg your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life; lo, we turn to the Gentiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded us, ſaying, I have ſet thee to be a light to the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldeſt be for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto the ends of the Earth. And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal Life, believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by the Ordaining here ſpoken of, if we take it for granted that there was a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gentiles, as there was of the Jews, ſo abſolutely given to Chriſt, as they ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall away; and that they were here ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpake this; for <hi>Antioch</hi> was an eminent place for Believers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they were firſt there called Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Yet however, this does no way prove that all believers are ſo Ordained to Everlaſting Life, ſo as they ſhall never finally fall away; for by the word of God it is abſolutely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as I have here proved: But as to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining here ſpoken of, when explained accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tenor of the Goſpel, it does appear to be no ſuch thing; for the Believer, upon his believing that Chriſt is the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. by which his Heart is drawn out in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, love and obedience to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. for
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:45720:290"/>it is a Faith that worketh by Love, is required, the which the ſinner no ſooner ſo believeth, but that all his paſt Sins are then forgiven him, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him, ſo as the Believer becomes compleat in him; for God by giving this Belief, reneweth his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in their Wills and Affections, ſo what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward is not wilfully committed, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; therefore by Chriſt we are reſtored to that we loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> For although the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that is thus Renewed, hath not an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perfect Righteouſneſs, yet he hath an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted perfect Righteouſneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10.
<hi>John</hi> 6.47. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>And therefore ſaid to be perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, The Believer hath Everlaſting Life in him. But him that thus ſtandeth, let him take heed leſt he fall. For our ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is like <hi>Adams</hi> in Paradice; for had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned, he had never Died. So the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if he ſins not wilfully, ſhall ever have this Eternal Life abiding in him, ſo as he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee Hell; for the Believer that is not of the very Elect, ſtands no ſecurer than our Firſt Parents did in Paradice; the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> make out, where he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2,3. <hi>I am jealous over you with a Godly jealouſy, for I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you a chaſt Virgin unto Chriſt. But I fear, leſt by any means, as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his Subtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> This is ſpoken of the Church which was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:45720:290"/>to Chriſt, and ſtood as our firſt Parents did, of whom he was afraid they ſhould be deceived, as our Firſt Parents were. And alſo by what he ſaith to them, of whom he ſaid, They were ordained to Eternal Life; the which Ordination, appears to be no other than this of the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> which was, that they were choſen of God for Eternal Life; and in being ſo, God put them into a caprcity of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in which they were continually to Labour, to make their Calling and Election ſure, 2
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. For the Eternal Life that the Believer here receiveth, they hold but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of their Obedience. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of theſe that were Ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.43. <hi>When the Congregation was broken up, many of the Jews, and Religious Proſelites followed Paul and Barnabas, who ſpeaking to them, perſwaded them to continue in the grace of God.</hi> Now theſe being thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of whom he ſaith in the 48. v. was Ordain'd to Eternal Life. Now had this Eternal Life been given abſolute, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he would not have perſwaded them to continue in the grace of God, for then he would have known they could not have fallen from it. Now this word ordain, is after the manner of ſpeaking, which St.
<hi>Paul</hi> doth apply to them that were made Biſhops, where he ſaith,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2.16. <hi>That Titus was Ordain'd Biſhop.</hi> The like word is applied to the Miniſters: When we ſay ſuch an one is an Ordain'd Miniſter, that is, when he is ſo made by the Church whom the King allows of, and this Ordination is for his<pb n="416" facs="tcp:45720:291"/>Life; upon which he receives his Benefice. But notwithſtanding this Ordination, and Benefice which is given him for his Life; yet if he is found in Rebellion to the King, his Ordination and Living, and his all is forfeited. And ſo it is with thoſe that God Renews and Reſtores, and puts into a capacity of Everlaſting Life: The gift being free as from God; but if any of them fell ſhort of Receiving it, it was becauſe they were wanting to themſelves. And alſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Therefore I endure all things for the Elect's ſakes, that they may alſo obtain the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which is in Chriſt Jeſus, with Eternal Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, there was a poſſibility that the Elect might not obtain Salvation; for whoſe ſake he had the more Afflictions laid on him, that he might be an example to them to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, concerning his Apoſtleſhip,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apoſtleſhip of the Circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee St. <hi>Peter</hi> was choſen the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, to whom he wrote this Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2.
<hi>Peter an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, to the ſtrangers ſcattered throughout Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia and Bythinia, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, according to the foreknowledg of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through Sanctification of the Spirit unto obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that he wrote this to the ſtrangers that were ſcattered throughout all thoſe places, whereby it is evident that it was <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whereas he ſaith in the 5. v. <hi>Who are kept by the Power of God through Faith unto Salvation, ready to be revealed in the laſt time.</hi> That is moſt certain that none can ſtand without the aſſiſtance of the Almighty God: Yet it was not impoſſible for ſome that were of the firſt Churches, through their own Neglect, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Subtilty, to fall away; therefore he ſaith 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.
<hi>Wherefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now from among the ſcattered Church was God's ſpecial Elect, which were ſo ſecured in Chriſt, that they could not fall away; and therefore in time to come, will be a choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, who were at that time but a ſcattered People.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 Tim. 2.11,12. <hi>It is a faithful ſaying. For if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him. If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him: if we deny him, he alſo will deny us.</hi> That is, Dead to all the

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:45720:292"/>of this World. In the 15. v. of the ſame Chapter, he ſaith, <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</hi> Here the Apoſtle lets us underſtand the word is ſo joyn'd, as there muſt be skill in the Dividing of it. And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> ſaith in the 2. chap. and the 18. v. <hi>Who concerning the Truth, have erred, ſaying that the Reſurrection is paſt already, and overthrew the Faith of ſome.</hi> 19. <hi>Nevertheleſs the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this Seal; the Lord knoweth them that are his. And let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from Iniquity.</hi> Now in the 18. v. he ſaith, <hi>That the Faith of ſome was overtheown, and that by the falſe Brethren.</hi> But in this verſe he ſaith, <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure.</hi> The which foundation is thoſe which are ſo abſolutely given to Chriſt, as they ſhould not fall away. Whilſt the other Elect were but called, renewed and put into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas he ſaith in the 20 verſe. <hi>But in a great Houſe there are not only Veſſels of Gold, and of Silver, but alſo wood and earth, ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour, if a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a Veſſel unto honour, Sanctified, and meet for the Maſters uſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto every good work.</hi> That is, the Gold and Silver are thoſe that are more abſolutely choſen of God; but the wood and ſtone, if they improve the benefits that God gives them,<pb n="420" facs="tcp:45720:293"/>and purge themſelves from an evil Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall become meet for the Maſter's uſe; ſhewing that there is a power in our ſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and amend, till ſuch time that by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting they exclude themſelves from his mercy.</p>
                  <p>And by the words of Chriſt we may receive certain Confirmation of this, by what he ſaith to the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3,4,5. <hi>And haſt born, and haſt patience, and for my ſake haſt laboured, and haſt not fainted. Nevertheleſs, I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt Love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place except thou repent.</hi> This ſhews that their Candleſtick was in the right place, but if they did not Repent, and do their firſt works, then Chriſt ſaid he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Candleſtick out of his place. And alſo the Lord ſaith to the Church of <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi>
3.1,2,3. <hi>I know thy works, that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt, and art dead. Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found thy works perfect before God. Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt and Repent. If therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a Thief, and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this doth ſhew, that one part of the Church was become dead through ſin, and ſo become forſaken of God, and therefore left off
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:45720:293"/>to hardneſs of Heart, and blindneſs of Mind, but to the other part that was ready to die, the Lord calls to them to come to Repentance, whereby we may know that when we have had the knowledg of God, and his ways, and he hath not withdrawn the good motions of his Spirit from us, There is a Power in us to come to Repentance and amendment of Life. For God calls not the People to come to Repentance after they have no Power in their Hand to do it; but then he ſaith, let them alone, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. When he will no farther ſhew mercy to them. Now in this Church there was three ſorts; one part Dead, another part ready to die, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part alive and well, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4,5. <hi>Thou haſt a few Names in Sardis, which have not defiled their Garments, and they ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white Raiment, and I will not blot his name out of the Book of Life, but I will confeſs his Name before my Father, and before his Angels.</hi> From which words it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains certain, that ſome names are blotted out of the Book of Life. And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>James</hi> 4.8,9,10. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you, cleanſe your Hands ye ſinners, and purify your Hearts ye double minded. Be afflicted and mourn, and weep, let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy into Heavineſs. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves in the Sight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up.</hi> And St.
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring forth therefore Fruits meet for repentance.</hi> For<pb n="422" facs="tcp:45720:294"/>we ſhall all be judged according to our works, and God doth not require of us, that which he hath not put us in a Capacity to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. <hi>And the Heathen that have not the Law, ſhall not be judged by the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in his Song, That their Feet ſhall ſlide in due time, hath a quite contrary meaning, to what we have apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, the which is fully explained, where I ſpeak of the Covenant and Song. As for the Promiſe made to <hi>David,</hi> mentioned in
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 99. is Anſwered where the ſpecial Election is Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe Controverſal Points being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opened to the bottom, whereby we may plainly ſee that the words of the Apoſtles had no ſuch meaning, as hitherto we have appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended them to have; and having the Oath and Word of God again and again, to aſſure us the contrary. And alſo Chriſt hath told us that whoſoever comes to him, he will in no wiſe caſt out, ſo that we need not fear to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, if we do not forſake him; and that God does not withdraw from the Soul, on purpoſe to leave them to fall into Sin, that he might Damn them; but God does try all his, to ſee if they will follow him; and if they ſo do, he is their exceeding great Reward. Now if any would have greater aſſurance than the Words and Oath of God, and the Word of Chriſt, muſt look to have it in their laſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I bleſs the Eternal God, by his open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:45720:294"/>his Word unto me, he hath brought me out of that dangerous miſtake, the which did ſo take off from the Glory of God, in that it did ſo much Eclipſe his Juſtice and Mercy, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him ſo partial a Judg, and alſo hurls the Soul into a ſleeping Lethargy of ſecurity, whilſt they fancy themſelves thus Elected, and makes them unmindful of the knowledg of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord; although he has told us if he comes upon us in an hour that we are not aware of, he will give us our Portion with Hypocrites and Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>Now having all along ſhewed you, what was the Election, or Calling of the firſt Chriſtian Churches; the which was after they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in Chriſt, they were to fight to keep their ground, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6.4,5. ſo as to make their calling and Election ſure; for elſe, as I have proved, the very Sealings of the Spirit might be cancelled to them. And although the Names of the Children of the Church are written in Heaven, yet they may be blotted out thence. For God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi>
32.33. <hi>Whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me, him will I blot out of my Book.</hi> And after God had eſpouſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he is ſaid to give her a Bill of Divorce, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1,2. <hi>And the Lord to the Church of Philadelphia, ſaith, hold faſt that thou haſt, that no man take they Crown.</hi> And Chriſt alſo ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19. <hi>If any man take away from the words of the Book of this Propheſy, God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of Life, and out of the Holy City, and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:45720:295"/>from the things that are written in this Book.</hi> We ſee that this was ſpoken to them that had a ſhare in the Book of Life, to let them know, that if they did wickedly, their part therein would be loſt, that is, taken from them.</p>

                  <p>NOW as to the Election of the Children of the Church, the which every ſincere Hearted Chriſtian is a Member If any of their Children dye in their Infancy, before they have been guilty of actual Sin, they are taken into Mercy, as being in Covenant, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.29. <hi>For the promiſe is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. And alſo the Covenant was made with their little ones,</hi> Deut. 29.11. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 Cor.
7.14. <hi>The unbelieving Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is Sanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctified by the Husband: Elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> Then if they are Holy, they are fit for Heaven, if tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away before they commit ſin. And the Lord ſaith in
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 2.29. <hi>My hands ſhall cover thee, ſo that thy Children ſhall not ſee Hell.</hi> By what is here ſaid, it is certain, that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of true Believers that are begotten after their Parents are Regenerated, are holy, and if they die in their Infancy, will be bleſſed. Now the Children of Believing Parents, being from their Birth in Covenant with God, they are by<pb n="425" facs="tcp:45720:295"/>their Parents, to be brought up in the ſtrict ways of Holineſs, that they may grow in Knowledg, and the fear of the Lord; and not look in for a New Call, but to walk with all diligence in the ways of God, that they may be made partakers of Eternal Life, which God hath promiſed to them that obey him; for God requireth fruit of us, as he did of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> we being the Children of the Viſible Church, which if he finds not, we ſhall likewiſe alſo be cut off. And God wonderfully commendeth <hi>Abraham,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> But we have not followed the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But O that we would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ways to be Wiſe, and cry out mightily to him that is able to ſave us, for he hath ſaid, They that ſeek me, ſhall find me, if they ſearch for me with the whole heart. So if we are not wanting to our ſelves, God will be found of us. But gray Hares are upon us, altho we know it not. O that we were well awakend out of this ſleeping Lethargy of ſloth and ſecurity, ſo as to take hold of the Covenant of God and Mercy, as it is offered by Chriſt, and to give our ſelves wholly up to him, beging ſtrength of him, that we may be inabled to live unto him, and perform the Conditions that

                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:45720:296"/>Now as to the ſpecial Elect. The which the Lord terms the very Elect, where he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>If it were poſſible they ſhould deceive the very Elect.</hi> And alſo of whom the Angel makes mention of, where he ſaith, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8. <hi>And they that dwell on the Earth ſhall wonder, whoſe names were not written in the Book of Life, from the Foundation of the World.</hi> The which Foundation, is as I have already proved to you, which Foundation of the World, was laid in
<hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> when the Lord fixt them in the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> For <hi>Iſrael</hi> was choſen to be the Foundation of the World of people which is now to come. And at which Foundation Chriſt was figuratively ſlain in the Paſchal Lamb. And the Lord foreſeeing the miſcarriage of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> it doth appear that God would have a certain number ſo ſecured, as they ſhould not fall away, but to remain as ſtanding wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes through the World. Whilſt the reſt were but put in a Capacity of obedience. Now at the deſtruction of the old World, it is ſaid,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Noah found grace in the Eyes of the Lord.</hi> And it is ſaid in the 9. v. <hi>Noah was a juſt man and perfect in his Generations, and</hi> Noah <hi>walked with God.</hi> That is, had walked in obedience to God, and had improved the Talent which God had given him. Whilſt the other had wholly corrupted their ways. As in the 12. v. <hi>And God looked upon the Earth, and behold it was corrupt, for all fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his way upon the Earth.</hi> But God find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="427" facs="tcp:45720:296"/>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> in the Capacity that he had put him, in that he had not corrupted his way, but had improved the Talent which he had given him, therefore was bleſſed of him. By which we may plainly ſee, that there was no abſolute election through the firſt World. And it doth appear, when God had again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the World in
<hi>Noah,</hi> As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.1. <hi>And God bleſſed</hi> Noah
<hi>and his Sons, and ſaid unto them, be fruitful and multiply, and replen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the Earth. And the fear of you, and the dread of you ſhall be upon every Beaſt of the Earth, and upon every Fowl of the Air, upon all that moveth upon the Earth, and upon all the Fiſh of the</hi> Sea, <hi>into your hand are they delivered.</hi> Now although after the floud, God had reſtored to man his power again, and put them all into a freſh Capacity of obedience, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they did almoſt all backſlide again. Then God choſe <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bleſſed him. As in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1.
<hi>And afterward he proved him, Gen.</hi> 2. And then Farther confirmed the bleſſing to him, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. And at the time appointed, according to his Promiſe, God did appear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his Seed out of the Land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and when he brought them into the Wilderneſs, he is ſaid to prove them there. And God kept. <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount with him but forty days, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was all fallen off to Idolatry, for which the Lord would have deſtroyed them all, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10,11,12.
<hi>Where God ſaith, now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:45720:297"/>hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them, and I will make of thee a great Nation.</hi> But thro' the Prayers of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> as in the 11. v. the Fierce Anger of the Lord was aſſwaged. The which gives us to underſtand, that there was no ſuch abſolute Election at that time. But rather from that time, God might give Chriſt a certain number, whoſe names might then be written in the Book of Life, that they ſhould be as a ſtanding witneſs through this World, if in caſe the Devil ſhould at any time draw off the reſt; yet ſtill there ſhould remain a ſtanding Witneſs, the which ſhould own the Truth; by which means, thoſe that did deſire the ways of Holineſs, might be recovered out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs again, by coming to have the knowledg of the Truth, and following their Example.</p>
                  <p>Now St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith in <hi>Acts</hi> 7.34.
<hi>That it was Chriſt that was in the Church in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And
<hi>Iſrael</hi> then being choſen for the foundation of the World to come, it does there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fully appear, that their Names were then put into the Book of Life, who ſhould be a ſtanding witneſs through the World, and ſo ſecured in Chriſt, as they ſhould not fall away. Of whom St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the <hi>Romans,</hi> after he had ſpoken of the wilful miſcarriage of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God hath put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a capacity of Obedience, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>But to Iſrael he ſaith, all the day long I have ſtretched forth my hands unto a diſobedient and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying People.</hi> But he afterward ſpeaking of<pb n="429" facs="tcp:45720:297"/>the Special Elect, he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.2. <hi>God hath not caſt away his People which he foreknew.</hi> That is, foreknew of the Church by their cloſe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him; and alſo in eſpecial manner, he doth here mean the very Elect, whoſe Names were written in Heaven from the Foundation of the World. Of whom he ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Even ſo then at this preſent time alſo there is a remnant according to the Election of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the foregoing verſe he there tells them, that God reſerved to himſelf ſeven Thouſand who had not bowed the Knee to the Image of <hi>Baal.</hi> So as there was then, ſo there was when Chriſt came, a Number according to the Election of Grace; the which were as a gift from the Father to Chriſt. And of theſe Chriſt ſpeaks in <hi>John</hi>
10.27,28,29,30. <hi>My ſheep hear my Voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me, is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand. I and my Father are one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee Chriſt does own theſe as a gift from the Father; and that they are ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, as they can never fall away. Now of his other Sheep the Lord ſpeaketh after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other manner, to let them know they ſtand not ſo ſecurely. For he ſaith, <hi>John</hi>
15.2,5,6,9,10,12,14. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> he that abideth in me,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:45720:298"/>and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.</hi> 6. <hi>If a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered, and men gather them, and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned.</hi> 9. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you, continue ye in my love.</hi> 10 <hi>If ye keep my Commandments ye ſhall abide in my love; even as I keep my Fathers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and abide in his love.</hi> 12. <hi>This is my Commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> 14. <hi>Ye are my Friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee our ſtanding is but upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the Conditions is the continuance in our Obedience; the which if we do not perfiſt in, though we were ingrafted into Chriſt, we ſhall be broken off, and caſt into the fire. And although we are in the love of Chriſt, yet we may, through our own default, not continue in it; whilſt the other ſheep are ſo abſolutely fixed in Chriſt, that they cannot fall away. And in
<hi>John</hi> 6.35,37. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the Bread of Life; he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> This includes their continuance in believing; the which belief is a practical belief, as I have elſewhere proved, where I have ſpoken of it. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me, ſhall come to me, and him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Now this was ſpoken to the <hi>Jews</hi> that believed not; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt told them, That all that the Father
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:45720:298"/>had given him, ſhould come to him, becauſe from them were a certain number of the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Elect: And Chriſt encourages all to come to him; for he ſaith, he that cometh to him, he will in no wiſe caſt out. So as none need fear being left of God, if they do not firſt forſake him. And that we may not forſake him, let us never truſt our ſelves with our ſelves, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually beg ſtrength and grace of him, whereby we may be enabled to live unto him; and if we ſo do, we ſhall find a continual ſupport from him.</p>
                  <p>And to be ſure none of the Jews was left of God to blindneſs of mind, that had in ſincerity lived in Obedience; but the blindneſs fell on them that had leaves only: That is, an Outward ſhew of Godlineſs, but denying the Power thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26. And the Lord ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 6.39,40. <hi>And this is the Fathers will which ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi> This alſo includes the ſpecial Elect; and by the Laſt Day is meant the Laſt Day of this World. But the Lord ſaith in 40 v. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Here this includes all believers, ſhewing, That if they do believe, it is then the Will of God that they ſhould ſo continue, that they might have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Life. By which it is very clear, That God doth not withdraw from any that believe,<pb n="432" facs="tcp:45720:299"/>becauſe that he would damn them; but it is they firſt forſake him, and ſo fall away. For it is the Will of God, our continuance in Well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to take to the Rules that he has ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, that we may ſo do. According to which Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 8.51. <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

That is, he ſhall never ſee Hell.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 10.14,15,16. I <hi>am the good Shepherd, and know my Sheep, and am known of mine.</hi> Here the Lord ſeems in a more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to ſignifie the very Elect. And in the following Words the Lord includes all the Sheep, as in the 15. v. <hi>As the Father knoweth me even ſo know</hi> I <hi>the Father; and</hi> I <hi>lay down my Life for the Sheep.</hi> Here is all the Sheep included. And the Lord ſaith in the 16. v.
<hi>And other Sheep</hi> I <hi>have, which are not of this Fold, them alſo muſt</hi> I <hi>bring, and they ſhall hear any Voice, and there ſhall be one Fold, and one Shepherd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Lord plainly declares to us, that he hath two ſorts of Sheep, and that they are not now of one fold. That is, the one does not now ſtand ſo ſecurely in him, as the other does, but he ſaith, He muſt bring them into one fold, at which time they ſhall hear his Voice. And then it is, there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd. And this will be when the Lord comes again to <hi>Mount Sion;</hi> at which time the Lord will make the promiſed New Covenant with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And then all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> will be ſo fixed in him that they ſhall never
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:45720:299"/>more fall away; For God ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17.
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.24,25,26,27,28. <hi>For I will take you from among the Heathen, and gather you out of all Countries, and I will bring you into your own land. Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new Heart alſo will I give you, a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony Heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments, and do them. And ye ſhall dwell in the land that I gave to your Fathers, and ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi> So it is ſaid, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19,20. and in
<hi>Jer.</hi> 32.37. <hi>Behold, I will gather them out of the Conntries, whither I have driven them in mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them again into this place, and will cauſe them to dwell ſafely. And they ſhall be my People, and I will be their God. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their Children after them. And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear in their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. Yea, I will rejoyce over them to do them good; I will plant them in this land aſſuredly, with my whole Heart, and with my whole Soul.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33.34. <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael, after thoſe days, ſaith the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:45720:300"/>Lord, I will put my Laws in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People, They ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know ye the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord, for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their ſin no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And God ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.9. <hi>But they ſhall ſerve the Lord their God, and David their King, whom I will raiſe up unto them.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.22. <hi>Therefore I will ſave my flock, and they ſhall no more be a prey, and I will judg between cattle and cattle. And I will ſet up one Shepherd over them, and he ſhall feed them, even my ſervant David, he ſhall feed them, and he ſhall be their Shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my ſervant David a Prince among them, I the Lord have ſpoken it. And I will make with them a Covenant of Peace, and will cauſe the Evil Beaſts to ceaſe out of the Land, and they ſhall dwell ſafely in the wilderneſs, and ſleep in the woods.</hi> And the Lord in
<hi>John</hi> having fully declared to us, that he hath two ſorts of Sheep; And that they are not now of one Fold, with thoſe that are the very Elect, but that he muſt bring them into one Fold; and then there ſhall be but one Fold, at that time, when there is but one Shepherd. And that will be, when the Lord maketh the Promiſed New Covenant with the Houſe of

                     <pb n="436" facs="tcp:45720:301"/>And although the reſt of the Elect that are to be called in at the coming of the Lord, have not that Everlaſting New Covenant made with them, as to ſecure their Off-ſpring, ſo as they ſhall never more fall away; yet they will ſtand ſecure whilſt the Eminent Glory is among them, and Satan bound up from them, and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tabernacle in their View; then they will all be of One Fold, ſo as none for that time ſhall fall off; according to which is the ſaying of the Lord in the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats; That the Sheep went into everlaſting Life. That is, that none of them which the Lord then will receive into Mercy, ſhall ever ſee Hell, but have Everlaſting Life, although they may afterward taſte of a Temporal Death, According to which the Lord ſaith, in
<hi>John</hi> 8.51. <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſayings, he ſhall never ſee Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is very clear, that the Lord did not mean, that they ſhould not die a Temporal Death, becauſe vve ſee that all die. So the Lord ſaid of all the Sheep, that they went into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, becauſe they were all of them then ſecured from Hell. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith to them to whom he wrote, wherein he includes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>John</hi>
3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 6.50. <hi>This is the Bread which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</hi>

                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:45720:301"/>We ſee when the Lord hath taken away the ſting of Death from his people, he afterwards counts their departure hence not a dying. So the Lord, after this way of ſpeaking, ſaid of his Sheep in the Parable, that they vvent into Life Eternal. Now if we will ever underſtand the Scriptures, we muſt underſtand the Scripture way of ſpeaking; and when the Lord comes, at which time his Sheep will be gaihered, then will Chriſts Sheep be brought into One Fold; and then ſhall we be all taught of God. Then it is there will be One Fold, and One Shepherd: And then alſo ſhall <hi>Japhet</hi> dwell in ths Tents of <hi>Shem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now as the very Elect follows the Lord through all Perſecutions and Afflictions, ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall obey him in the fullneſs of all things. Now the Lord, when he was upon the Earth, ſpake to the Jews in dark Sentences and Parables, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeeing might not ſee, and hearing they might not underſtand. The which makes the ſayings of Chriſt more dark to us. Now that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and

<hi>Albigenſes</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtedfaſt, and being never drawn off by the beaſt, it doth certainly appear, they are the very Elect ſpoken of by Chriſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.24. Now the Lord ſaid to his Diſciples,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. <hi>Your Names are witten in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But he did not ſay to them, that their Names were written in Heaven from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World; and altho it doth appear that the Names of the Children of the Church are written in Heaven, by what God ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.33. <hi>And the Lord ſaid to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me, him will I blot out of my book.</hi> And by what <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the Enemies of Chriſt, as in
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. <hi>Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Living, and not be written with the Righteous.</hi> By which it doth appear, that the Children of the Church, as they come into the World; that their Names are written in Heaven, till by their Sin, their Names are blotted out thence; for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being made with them and their Children, the which ſhews that the Childrens Names muſt be written in the Book of Life, till ſuch time, that by their wilful ſinning they Exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Mercy promiſed by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and then are their Names blotted out of the Book of Life. Now, whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſaith, That they were choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the World.</p>
                  <p>So here in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> thoſe that ſhould
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:45720:302"/>remain a ſtanding Witneſs, are ſaid to be Written in the book of Life, from the foundation of the World, the which fully declares there is a two fold meaning in it. The which is as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved to you.</p>
                  <p>Now it being impoſſible to deceive the very Elect, it does thereby appear to be the Jews, becauſe there was a certain ſelect number choſen of the Jews, the which was according to the Election of Grace, the which the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes appear; and the words of Chriſt doth ſeem to ſignify as much, where he ſpeaks of the Sheep which his Father had given him, as in <hi>John</hi> 10.27,28,29. Now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Jews were ſaid to be all warned to go out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> before the Deſtruction thereof; but where they went we know not: And they being Chriſtians, and living amongſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it might be thoſe that retained their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when all the reſt fell away.</p>
                  <p>And ſo theſe <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and
<hi>Albigenſes,</hi> do therefore appear to be theſe Chriſtian Jews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſaid, there is a certain number of the ſews that does follow the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth. And alſo it is ſaid, when the Servants of God were to be Sealed, there was a certain number of every Tribe Sealed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Dan, Rev.</hi> 7.3,4. <hi>The Angel ſaying, hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the Trees, till we have ſealed the Servants of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the firſt place he ſaith, he heard the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that were ſealed, but he does not tell us what that number was; but leaving that, he goes on and tells us how many were Sealed of all the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> And in the following verſe, he ſaith of every Tribe there was Sealed twelve Thouſand. And having ſpoken of the Sealing, he ſaith in <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. <hi>After this I beheld, and lo, a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which no man could number, of all Nations and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands.</hi> 10. v. <hi>And cried with a loud voice, ſaying, Salvation to our God which ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb.</hi> This appears to be ſpoken of the raiſed Saints, and the Glorious Tabernacle where the Throne of God will be. And whereas he ſaith in the 11. v. <hi>And all the Angels ſtood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and the four Beaſts, and fell before the Throne on their Faces, and worſhiped God.</hi> Now theſe four Beaſts doth ſeem to be the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Nations that are ſaved alive, to live upon the Earth, after the Glory of the Lord is manifeſt, that then they will be gathered to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> to Worſhip, where the Throne of God will be in the glorious Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Now in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. There is no mention made of the multitude of People of all Nations that<pb n="441" facs="tcp:45720:303"/>were clothed in white robes, therefore the four Beaſts there ſpoken of, do appear to be the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints; and alſo they are there ſaid to be round about the Throne, and in the midſt of the Throne; and they are ſaid to have Wings; which ſhews they are exalted above the Earth. But in the 7th Chap. the Beaſts are not there ſaid to have Wings, neither to be round about the Throne, nor in the midſt of the Throne; but they are there ſaid to Worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne; that is, before the glorious Tabernacle, where the Throne of God will be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.21. And the Pavement of the glorious Tabernacle will be like, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.6. a Sea of glaſs, as clear as Criſtial, ſo that his People that are then left upon the Earth, may through the Sea of Glaſs, behold the infinite Glory of the Lord, and the Glory of the Angels, and raiſed Saints that are with him. Now that the Lord doth term the People of this World, beaſts, is evident by what the Angel ſaid, <hi>Eſd.</hi> 11.39. <hi>Art not thou it that remaineth of the Beaſts, whom I made to reign in my Woold,

                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe Beaſts ſpoken of here, are the wicked of the World, which have had the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the end of theſe evil times will come through them. But the Beaſts ſpoken of in the two forementioned Chapters of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> in the 4th Chap. the beaſts are the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints.

                     </hi> 14.1,2,3. <hi>I looked, and lo,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:45720:304"/>a Lamb ſtood on Mount Sion, and with him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty and four thouſand, having his Fathers Name written in their Foreheads. And I heard a Voice from Heaven, as the voice of many Waters, and as the Voice of a great Thunder: And I heard the Voice of Harpers Harping with their Harps. And they Sung as it were a new Song, before the Throne, and before the four Beaſts, and the Elders; and no man could learn that Song, but the hundred and forty and four thouſand, which were Redeemed from the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the hundred forty and four thouſand is meant the very Elect. The which certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth appear to be found in Chriſt at his coming, although we have not known them. And this Song which they ſung, which no man could learn, it might be becauſe they were taken away from the Earth, and therefore from among Men: for the raiſed Saints are not called Men. And it is ſaid of them, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4,5. <hi>Theſe are they which were not defiled with Women; for theſe are Virgins: Theſe are they which follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth: Theſe were redeemed from among men, being the firſt fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and the Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in Heaven we are not to think there is diſtinction of Age or Sex, and therefore it being ſaid, they were not defiled with Women when they were upon the Earth, was, that they were not guilty of Idolatrous Worſhip: for Idolatry in Scripture is often termed Fornication and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. So theſe not only having kep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<pb n="443" facs="tcp:45720:304"/>from Idolatry, but in all other things they had lived Exemplary Lives; as in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.5. <hi>In their mouth was found no guile, for they are without fault before the Throne of God.</hi> And <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> ſaith, in 2
<hi>Eſdras</hi> 2.42,43,44,45,46,47. <hi>I Eſdras ſaw upon Mount Sion a great people, whom</hi> I <hi>could not number, and they all praiſed the Lord with Songs.</hi> 43. v. <hi>And in the midſt of them there was a young man of bigh ſtature, taller than all the reſt, and upon every one of their heads he ſet Crowns, and was more exalted, which</hi> I <hi>marvelled at greatly.</hi> 44. v. <hi>So I asked the Angel, and ſaid, Sir, what are thoſe?</hi> 45. <hi>He anſwered, and ſaid unto me, theſe be they that have put off mortal cloathing, and put on the immortal, and have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Name of God: Now are they crowned, and receive Palms.</hi> 46. v. <hi>Then ſaid I to the Angel, What young perſon is it that crowneth them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them Palms in their hands?</hi> 47. v. <hi>So he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and ſaid unto me, it is the Son of God, whom they have confeſſed in the World. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan I greatly to commend them that ſtood ſo ſtiffly for the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Novv this <hi>Mount Sion</hi> is the Glorious Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, which ſhall be Revealed when the Lord again cometh; and where the raiſed Saints, and thoſe Saints which are changed from mortal to immortal ſhall be Crowned.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the word of the Lord, which <hi>Nathan</hi> brought to <hi>David,</hi> is in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Now therefore, ſo ſhall thou ſay unto my ſervant David, thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I took thee<pb n="444" facs="tcp:45720:305"/>from the Sheep-cote, from following the ſheep, to be ruler over my people, over Iſrael.</hi> 9. <hi>And I was with thee whitherſoever thou wenteſt, and have cut off all thine Enemies out of thy ſight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the Earth.</hi> 10. <hi>Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Iſrael, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more: neither ſhall the children of wickedneſs afflict them any more, as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</hi> In this laſt verſe here is that which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable in it, in that the Lord ſaith, Moreover, I will appoint a place for my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and in that, God ſaid, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither ſhould the Children of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Afflict them: Now at that time were they in <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſettled and Conquerers over all their Enemies round about; yet at this time the Lord eſteems it not a place of their own, becauſe for their ſins they ſhould be removed thence, but God terms it a place of their own, when that time is come, in which they ſhall remove no more.</p>
                  <p>And as to what the Prophet ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.13. <hi>He ſhall build an houſe for my Name, and I will eſtabliſh the Throne of his Kingdom for ever.</hi> 14.
<hi>I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Son: If he commit iniquity, I will chaſten him with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the Children of men.</hi> 15. <hi>But my mercy ſhall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul,<pb n="445" facs="tcp:45720:305"/>whom I put away before thee. And thine houſe, and thy Kingdom ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever before thee; thy throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe we here ſee that it hath its Reference to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> in that they were not caſt off upon their Offending, as <hi>Saul</hi> was; and ſo to Chriſt in time to come, at which time his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed forever, which ever, is the ever of the World to come; This being according to what the Angel told <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 1.32. <hi>He ſhall be great, and ſhall he called the Son of the higheſt; and the Lord God ſhall give unto him the throne of his Father David.</hi> 33. <hi>And he ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> Now as to what the Pen-man of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99. ſaith, in the rehearſal of the meſſage ſent by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> which has its ſpecial Reference to Chriſt, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the 27. v. of <hi>Pſal.</hi>
89. <hi>Alſo I will make him my firſt born, higher than the Kings of the Earth.</hi> 28. v. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore; my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him.</hi> 29. v. <hi>His ſeed alſo will I make to endure for ever, and his Throne as the days of Heaven.</hi> 30. v. <hi>If his Children forſake my Law, and not walk in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> 31. v. <hi>If they break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments.</hi> 32. v. <hi>Then will I viſit their Tranſgreſſions with a Rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes.</hi> 33. v. <hi>Nevertheleſs, my loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> 34. v.
<hi>My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:45720:306"/>lips.</hi> 35. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs, that I will not lie unto David.</hi> 36. v. <hi>His Seed ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being peculiarly meant by Chriſt in the time of his glorious Kingdom; and that to us and the body of the Jewiſh Church it belongs not; in that God, Chriſt, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> do declare the contrary, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5,6. <hi>If we wilfully fall away, after we have taſted the good word of God, and of the Powers of the World to come, the Apoſtle ſaith, we cannot be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again by Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore this Promiſe is not made to us. And alſo now God proves and tries his; and here in this world commonly God's beſt Saints ſuffers the greateſt Afflictions. And as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>Hebrews</hi> 12.6. <hi>For whom the Lord lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> 7. <hi>If ye endure Chaſtening, God deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with you as Sons: For what Son is he whom the Father chaſteneth not?</hi> 8. <hi>But if ye be without Chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons.</hi> And after all, if we fall away, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledg of the truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſins.</hi> 27. v. <hi>But a certain fearful looking for of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when this promiſe was made, annext to this Threatning, there is no Afflictions threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them that do well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="447" facs="tcp:45720:306"/>Now <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at their firſt entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> was upon their Obedience promiſed Proſperity, and Plenty of all things, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. but we by the Goſpel are promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuch thing; but on the contrary, ſorrow affliction, and perſecution; and if we hold out to the end, we ſhall receive a Crown of Life, which the Lord the righteous Judg ſhall give at that day: unto all them that Love his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. not only to the raiſed Saints, but unto them that he will find ſo at his coming, for when we are put paſt the power of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death, and all ſin and ſorrow done away, then we receive a Crown of Life. And the Lord ſaith of them that keep his ſayings, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>That they ſhall never ſee death;</hi> and if ſo, after ſin and ſorrow is gone, then it is we have the Crown of Life.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt again comes to take the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then
<hi>Iſrael</hi> will be ſo fixt in the Lord, as they ſhall not ſin againſt him. And for the thouſand years that the Glory of the Lord is more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently viſible, and Satan bound up, then ſhall all the Families of the Earth be bleſſed in Chriſt. But after that time, when the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Glory of the Lord is not ſo Viſible, and Satan again looſed, then will he ſeek for the new Brood of the young ones, that was left of the old Stock; and who theſe young ones are ſaid to be, I have already told you, was ſold by
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo ſcattered upon the Earth; and he will draw off as many of the Gentiles as he<pb n="448" facs="tcp:45720:307"/>can with them, with the chief Prince of <hi>Meſhech</hi> and <hi>Tubal,</hi> which are of the Race of
<hi>Japhet,</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.2. and in 1 <hi>Chr.</hi> 1.5. which will be the <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Ezek.</hi>
38.2. <hi>Son of Man, ſet thy face againſt Gog, the land of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog, the chief Prince of Meſhech and Tubal, and Propheſy again him.</hi> And in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 20.8. There is <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> again ſpoken of. Now, after Satan has deluded theſe to their Deſtruction, then it is ſaid,
<hi>Zac.</hi> 14.16. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that every one that is left of all the Nations which came againſt Jeruſalem, ſhall even go up from year to year to worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts, and to keep the Feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi> Now theſe here ſpoken of that are left of all the Nations that came againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are thoſe that came not up to Fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for as many as went up to Fight againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of all the Nations, as many as were left of them will be deſtroyed by the Plagues that are ſet down in the 12. v. of the ſame chap.; and after the Deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and
<hi>Magog,</hi> the Devil is ſaid to be caſt into Hell for ever and for ever; which ſignifies it will be a long time before the final Judgment, becauſe there is mention made of two evers, For the next World conſiſteth of one ever.</p>
                  <p>Now after the deſtruction of theſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord ſaith in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.17. <hi>And it ſhall be, that whoſoever will not come up of all the Families of the Earth unto</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>to worſhip the King, the Lord of Hoſts,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:45720:307"/>even upon them ſhall be no Rain.</hi> Here we ſee God threatens them but with a Temporal Puniſhment. So when this glorious time is come, that Chriſt and his People hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power; then will this Promiſe, in the 89. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> be of force, to the People of the World to come: For altho <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be ſo ſecured in the Lord, that they cannot ſin againſt him: Yet the other promiſed Elect will not ſo ſecurely ſtand. And here finding in <hi>Zachariah</hi> but a Temporal Puniſhment threatned, after that laſt overthrow; I therefore do believe that the words in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> hath a reference to that time to come. For where this Chaſtiſement is ſpoken of in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it is alſo ſaid in the 29. v. <hi>That his Throne ſhall continue as the days of Heaven.</hi> And now this particular Throne of Chriſt is not, for he is ſaid to ſit now on the Throne of his Father, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12,13.
<hi>But this man, after he had offered one Sacrifice for ſins, for ever ſate down on the right hand of God. From henceforth expecting till his Enemies be made his Footſtool.</hi> The ever here Spoken of, is meant of the ever of this World, which World is the wicked People; and when the ever of their time is expired, then will his Foes be made his Footſtool.</p>
                  <p>And then, as to what is ſaid of the Glorious Kingdom of Chriſt, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89. will then be made manifeſt, as in 27. to
37. v. <hi>Alſo I will make him my Firſt-born: higher than the Kings of the Earth. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore<pb n="450" facs="tcp:45720:308"/>and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him. His Seed alſo will I make to endure for ever: and his Throne as the days of Heaven. If his Children forſake my Law, and walk not in my Judgments. If they break my Statutes, and keep not my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their iniquity with Stripes. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him: Nor ſuffer my Faithfulneſs to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the things that is gone out of my Lips. Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs, that I will not lie unto</hi> David. <hi>His ſeed ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me. It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever as the Moon: and as a faithful witneſs in Heaven. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah.</hi> Here we ſee that theſe Promiſes hath only a reference as to the time of Chriſt's glorious Kingdom, and in the former part of the
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> it has a reference to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> and whether, or no, this promiſe, now in this time hath any further reference as to the Natural Seed of <hi>David,</hi> is uncertain, but becauſe of
<hi>Manaſſah,</hi> I am apt to think it might have a further reference to a Line in his Seed; and the promiſe concludes in a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in that it is ſaid, my loving kindneſs will I not take from him; that is, Not from
<hi>David, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he bore the ſins of the World. Now the Church is no where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as <hi>He,</hi> but always term'd a <hi>She, they</hi> or <hi>them;</hi> and ſo in this promiſe, is neither included the Body of the Church, in this time, or in that<pb n="451" facs="tcp:45720:308"/>time that is to come; for then is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and as many of us as ſhall become new Creatures, will then be put into ſuch a capacity as never to offend any more, and therefore to receive no more ſtripes; but the promiſe is not ſo then to <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syrria,</hi> therefore to them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after the Thouſand Years, there is but upon their offending, threatned a temporal puniſhment, as in <hi>Zach.</hi>
14.17,18.</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18.
<hi>We know that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not: but he that is begotten of God, keepeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> This he ſpeaks of them, whom Chriſt terms his very Elect, who does not wilfully commit ſin, and who are ſo ſecured in Chriſt, that they cannot fall away, and alſo their diligence is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ways of God, as it is ſaid of them, They keep themſelves ſo, as the evil one touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not; accordingly it is ſaid of them which are to be ſealed for the glorious Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. <hi>That they followed the Lamb whereſoever he goeth.</hi> And alſo 5. v. <hi>They were without fault before the Throne of God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we would know our Election and Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let us examin our ſelves how cloſely we walk with God, ſince it is thoſe that ſecurely ſtand, that keep themſelves as the evil one touch them not. That is, they improve all the grace that God has given them, as they are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves, but that we do not all ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:45720:309"/>ſtand, as I have fully proved by Chriſt and all the Apoſtles, it being yet but a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Covenant, but ſo, if we will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves, God will never leave us nor forſake us; but as for tryals we muſt expect. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, If we once have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, and a belief and delight in the ways of God, and then wilfully fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he then ſaith, There remains no hope, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6.4,5,6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe that were once inlightned, and have taſted of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt. And have taſted the good word of God, and the Powers of the World to come; if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again by repentance; ſeeing they Crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame.</hi> And alſo he farther ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. to the 31.
<hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledg of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for ſin. But a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes's <hi>Law, died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorer punſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was Sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight unto the Spirit of Grace. For we know him that ſaid, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Accordingly it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20,21.</p>

Now we ſee by thoſe Scriptures, before mentioned, that wilfully and preſumptiouſly to Sin, after we are once Regenerated; as to have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, ſo as to taſt the good word of God, and the Powers of the World to come: That is, to have a belief in his Word, and the experience of the love of God to our Souls, after which to fall away and ſin wilfully, by the words of the Apoſtles, it clearly appears to be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, in that he ſaith, They Crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, for which there remains no more Sacrifice for ſin, but a fearful looking for of Judgment in Fiery, Indignation, which ſhall conſume the Adverſary; But to the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or outward Church, that have not had the ſaving Knowledg of God, they have far larger extent, before ſin in them is termed the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is as far as to the abſolute renouncing God and Chriſt, as Witches do, or to do a thing in deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate did, when he threw duſt into the Air in deſpite, and ſaid thou haſt overcome me, thou <hi>Galilean.</hi> And as to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of the falſe Teachers, they are in much the like condition; for he ſaith in <pb n="454" facs="tcp:45720:310"/>the 2. chap.
3. ver. <hi>Through Covetuouſneſs ſhall they with feigned words make Merchandiſe of you, whoſe judgment now of a long time lingreth not, and their damnation ſtumbreth not.</hi> And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually check Conſcience till it is mute, that thereby God leaves them to blindneſs of Mind, and hardneſs of Heart, we have little reaſon to think that it will prove any other, than the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Now there has been ſome that I have read of, that has been drawn in to ſell themſelves to the Devil, for ſome by-end or other, neither out of hatred to good, but to attain that which they have deſired. And that through the fervent Prayers of the Faithful God hath made the Devil to Reſign up their bond again, the which
<hi>Fauſtus</hi> thought to do, but in the end he was miſerably deceived.</p>
                  <p>And whereas St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1,2.
<hi>My little Children, theſe things write I unto you, that ye ſin not. And if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> And he farther ſaith, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16,17. <hi>If any man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin which is not unto Death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him Life for them that ſin not unto Death. There is a ſin unto Death; I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it. All unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is ſin, and there is a ſin not unto Death.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31,32. <hi>All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall<pb n="455" facs="tcp:45720:310"/>not be forgiven unto men. And whoſoever ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the World to come.</hi> That is, whoſoever ignorantly ſpeaks againſt the Son of Man (which is Chriſt) it ſhall be forgiven him. But if he ſpeaks againſt the Son of Man, Chriſt, Knowingly, ſo as the Spirit of God doth bear Witneſs to them, that he is the Son of God, then there appears to be no forgiveneſs for them in this World, nor in the World to come. And although all theſe ſins and Blaſphemies are to be forgiven unto men, except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. The which forgiveneſs is before Converſion upon Repentance; but after they are Regenerated, there is no ſuch Pardon, for ſuch crying ſins, as the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> makes clearly Evident, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,5,6. and in <hi>Heb.</hi>
10.26,27,28,29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 20.21. and Chriſt himſelf ſaith in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall deny me before men, him will I alſo deny before my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the ſins in the Saints conſiſts of three ſorts. Firſt, ſins of Ignorance. Secondly, ſins of Infirmity. Thirdly, ſins of Surpriſal. The which if we ſo fall, it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.24.
<hi>He ſhall not utterly be caſt down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Peter</hi> is no example to us; for the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from him, for having any confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and to admoniſh us, that we might not truſt ourſelves, but go to God for ſtrength.</p>

                  <head>Of the Tree of Life, and the Tree of Knowledg, both of good and evil.</head>
                  <p>When God Created Man, he ſo far Created them, as he did the Angels, in that he gave them Eternal Life; ſo if they had never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they had never died; and alſo, in that God made Man perfectly Righteous, and gave them a freedom of will, ſo as they might have choſen the Good, and refuſed the Evil; but there being then in Paradice an oppoſite to God, and all Good; God forewarned Man of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Name, or by the repreſentation of the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil; for all was of God made Good, but by the Devils departure from him, he became Evil; and ſo thereby he became as the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Good and Evil. Now where the Trees are ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. <hi>And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every Tree that is pleaſant to the Sight, and good for Food, the Tree of Life alſo in the midſt of the Garden, and the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil.</hi> Whereas it is ſaid, That out of the Ground the Lord made to grow every Tree that is pleaſant to the ſight, and good for Food, after which, it is ſaid, the Tree of Life alſo in the midſt of the Garden, and the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil. Now it is not plainly ſaid that theſe two Trees grew out of the Ground; but by the words that go before, we have taken it to be ſo. But by<pb n="457" facs="tcp:45720:311"/>what <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſaith, it appears but as a Vail put on that word; but however, it is certain that the Tree of Life was the repreſentative of Chriſt, and the Tree of Knowledg of Good and Evil, was the repreſentative of the Devil; And had Man firſt taken and eaten of the Tree of Life, without doubt he had then been paſt the power of Satan's deluſion, ſo that he ſhould in no wiſe have adheard to him, which in Scripture is term'd eating, as in <hi>John</hi> 6.57.
<hi>As the living Father hath ſent me; and as I live by the Father: So, he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> eating of the contrary Tree, it became Death in him; for they had no ſooner eaten of that Tree, but the whole maſs of mankind was corrupted, and then they found their Natures and Inclinations changed; whereby the ſhame of their Nakedneſs did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and by which way Satan got an entrance into the Soul ſo as to ſuggeſt what he pleaſeth, and alſo to ſute his temptations according to our inclinations, but when the time of reſtitution cometh, as the bodies of the Saints are raiſed, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> again reſtored, then in paradice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, is the Tree of Life, but then the Tree of Knowledge, of good and evil, is not there; but ſeal'd up from them, as in <hi>Eſd.</hi> 8.51.
<hi>But underſtand thou for thy ſelf, and ſeek out the Glory for ſuch as be like thee.</hi> 52. v. <hi>For unto you Paradice is opened the Tree of Life is plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the time to come is prepar'd, plenteouſneſs is made ready, a City is builded, reſt is allowed, the <pb n="458" facs="tcp:45720:312"/>perfect goodneſs and wiſdom.</hi> 53. v. <hi>The Root of evil is ſealed up from from you, weakneſs and the moth is hid from you, and corruption is fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell to be forgotten.</hi> Here the Lord ſaith, the evil root ſhall be ſealed up. And in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> it is ſhewed who this evil root is, that will be ſealed up. As in the <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1. <hi>And I ſaw an Angel come down from Heaven, having the Key of the Bottomleſs Pit, and a great Chain in his hand.</hi> 2. v. <hi>And he laid hold on the Dragon, that Old Serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thouſand years.</hi> 3. v. <hi>And Caſt him into the Bottomleſs Pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould not deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand years be fulfilled: And after that he muſt be looſed a little Seaſon.</hi> Here it is clearly ſhewed who this evil root is, that ſhall be ſealed up, and although it ſaid he ſhall be looſed for a little ſeaſon, yet never after to deceive them of the Glorious Tabernacle, nor <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2. There is made mention of the Tree of Life, but no mention of the Tree of Knowledge, of good and evil. Therefore by all theſe places it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, that the Tree of Knowledge, of good and evil was the Devil.</p>

                  <head>Perfect.</head>
                  <p>And whereas the Lord ſaith in St. <hi>Matthew, Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is perfect.</hi> And it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting down imaginations, and every high thing that<pb n="459" facs="tcp:45720:312"/>exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into Captivity every thought to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt.</hi> If we ſo do, then Chriſt will impute his perfect Righteouſneſs to us. And ſo as it is ſaid in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We ſhall be compleat in him</hi> And if ſo, then perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, through his righteouſneſs put upon us. And whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8,9,10. <hi>Yea, doubtleſs, I count all things but loſs, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt: And be found in him, not having mine own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith. That I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.</hi> By which we ſee, if we are made partakers of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, we muſt be brought into a holy Conformity to Chriſt, as being dead to the ſinful Pleaſures of this World, that we might live to him that died for us.</p>
                  <p>And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11,12. tells us wherefore he was thus conformable, which was, <hi>If by any means I might attain unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead. Not as though I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, either were already perfect. But I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="460" facs="tcp:45720:313"/>Now by what is here ſaid, we may clearly underſtand, that though <hi>Paul</hi> was regenerated and born again, yet he ſaith, he was not come to the Reſurrection of the dead. And whereas he ſaith, Not as though I had already attained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were already perfect. Now he had thoſe Qualifications whereby the Saints are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſo as to be accounted perfect, or compleat in him. Yet he here ſaith, he was not perfect. Therefore the Righteouſneſs he here ſpeaks of, was not of an Imputed Perfect Righteouſneſs, but of an Inherent Perfect Righteouſneſs, which is only attainable for the Righteous at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead; and then it is that he ſhall fully apprehend that Infinite Love and Mercy by which he was apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi>
3.14,15. <hi>I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, <hi>be thus minded.</hi> Here he ſpeaks of the perfection of the Will, in which conſiſts their ſincere Obedience to Chriſt, by which they become partakers of the perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs purchaſed by Chriſt. And whereas he ſaith in the latter part of the ſame verſe, <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal this unto you.</hi> This he ſaid to them that were perfect in ſincerity in their obedience to Chriſt, that if they had not attained to that clear knowledg of God in their mind, as he had, yet God would Reveal the ſame unto them, by enlightning their underſtanding in what he had taught them.</p>

                  <head>The Scriptures being now Rightly Underſtood are made to agree in a Holy Harmony ſo as Juſtice Mercy and Truth, go hand in hand together; which before we came to have a right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the Word, we made to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it ſelf, which has caus'd ſo much Diſſention amonſt us.</head>
                  <p>Some there are that term the word a dead letter; but all them that believe the ſcriptures to be the word of God and take to the way directed therein, ſuch the ſcriptures are able to make wiſe unto ſalvation 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15,16 18. for by them we come to have faith in Chriſt Jeſus, as to believe that he will perform his promiſe according to the condition he hath made in the word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.

                  <p>And in the Scriptures is the Wiſdom of God and the power of God. and ſuch as walk according to that Holy rule, bleſſed are they,

                  <p>The Truths which have not been rightly underſtood are theſe that follow,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That the Eternal Purpoſe only reacheth forward to the Eternity that lies before us, as is proved; like as Chriſt in time became the Author of Eternal Salvation, and as God in time promiſed Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That after <hi>Adam</hi> fell, the decree was made for the entrance into Life, to be made ſtrait; and how that ſtraitneſs doth conſiſt, is proved.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That being of old ordained to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath another meaning than what we have hitherto apprehended.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In Scripture there is mention made of Three Worlds, and therefore Three Foundations, whereby it is clearly proved, there was none choſen before, or at the Foundation of the Material Heavens and Earth: and that theſe Three Worlds ſpoken of in Scripture, are Three Worlds of People. Firſt, <hi>That which ſprang from</hi> Adam. Secondly, <hi>That which ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing from the ſeed of</hi> Noah. Thirdly, <hi>That the foundation of the World to come, was laid in the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>when God brought them out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and laid them for the foundation of the World to come; and all<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45720:316"/>that comes in heirs to that World, comes in as the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and from the foundation of that World, Chriſt was figuratively ſlain in the Paſchal Lamb; and from the foundation of that World was the works of thoſe unbelieving Jews finiſhed, when they, through their unbelief, refuſed to go to fight for the Land of</hi> Canaan: <hi>And then after this their miſcarriage, God Elected and Secured a certain Remnant in Chriſt of that foundation which was then a laying in Iſrael for the world to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. It is likewiſe proved, That there was no Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thorough the old World, nor till the then time; and for <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſinfulneſs, God did Elect and make choice of the firſt Gentile Churches, and God choſe them before the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but not as to matter of time, but as to matter of choice and likeing in God, rather to chooſe them that had ignorantly offended him, then them that had willfully diſobeyed him, as is proved: and therefore they are ſaid to be choſen before the Foundation, which Foundation was <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. It was the Remnant choſen from among
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the firſt Gentile Churches, that had the peculiar call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for from among the Gentiles did God then chooſe a People to the praiſe of his Name, which were choſen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of the will of God, for the purpoſe he had determined; which was to receive the Holy Ghoſt, &amp; to bear their teſtimony to the Truth of the Goſpel. <hi>And alſo that in them in time to come he might ſhew forth the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Riches of his Grace.</hi> Theſe were thoſe that firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word from the mouth of the Diſciples, and ſo believed in Chriſt thorough their word.</p>
                  <p>And it was by the Example of the Elect, that all they of

                  <p>Theſe were thoſe for whom Chriſt in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner prayed for, as he did not for the World; theſe were thoſe that were Glorified by their Receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. for

1.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>God daily added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> that was ſpoken to
<hi>Iſrael</hi> as is proved; for of them there was ſome excluded the then offered Mercy, but by the evident witneſs of the Spirit that was given to the Elect, was the Gentile Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons convinced of the Truth of the Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and ſo became the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Chrtſt,</hi> in yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their aſſent to the Obedience of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. But when the Nations came to have no love to the Truth, that they might be ſaved, but took pleaſure in Iniquity; God then gave them up to ſtrong Deluſions that they might believe lyes, and ſo worſhip the Beaſt; for as <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ſin was left to blindneſs, ſo the Gentile Nations for ſin were left to Deluſion; for when their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers would no longer be holden with the cords of the Laws of the Lord, then did God permit them to be deceived by the Beaſt, ſo as to give their power unto him, and then did the Beaſt deprive the Nations of the Goſpel, by which God calls to his Creatures to walk in Newneſs of Life, that they may become heirs to the Promiſes.</p>

Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>The Promiſe was not to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed after the Fleſh, but the ſeed in Chriſt and Iſaac was the ſeed to whom the Promiſe was made, by whom the natural ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>is included as well as the Adopted.</hi> But neither to the Natural Seed, nor the Adopted Seed that live after the will of the Fleſh, are they to whom the<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45720:317"/>Promiſe belongs, but to them that live according to the Spirit, in Obedience to the Word, are them to whom the promiſe is made, and the promiſe is, <hi>That in time to come, God will eſtabliſh his Everlaſting Covenant with them.</hi> the which crowns Life to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Abraham
<hi>believed God and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> And that which <hi>Abraham</hi> believed was, that in the way of his Obedience he ſhould become heir to the Promiſes, and therefore he left his Countrey, his Kindred and his Fathers Houſe; and for the Promiſe ſake God made to
<hi>Abraham, That he ſhould be the Father of many Nations;</hi> therefore when he firſt took the Gentiles into Covenant with himſelf, he did then declare his Righteouſneſs in being juſt to his Promiſe which he had made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in then Juſtifying them that believed in
<hi>Jeſus.</hi> For the Gentiles believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Salvation was to be had by him according to his word, which was by taking his Yoke upon them, in a willingneſs to render their ſincere Obedience to him, and thereupon they were Juſtified of God, from their paſt ſins, in and thro' Chriſt, by their willingneſs to obey him for the time to come, and the Reward promiſed was to be received both by <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, according as they ſhould afterward perform the conditions.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Whereas Chriſt ſaith, In believing that he is the Son of God, is the Rock on which he built his Church, and his Church is not only his Elect, but likewiſe all them that obey him; againſt whom the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail. <hi>For he is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Heb. 5.9. For the Faith that God requireth of us, is to believe that he is, <hi>and that he is a rewarder of them that dilligently ſeek him.</hi> Heb. 11.6. For a Believer is no longer a Believer, than he believes Salvation is to be had by Chriſt, according as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his word, which is, in the way of his Obedience, no more than a Righteous Man is a Righteous Man in the day that he commits Iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Good Works is<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45720:317"/>proved by the word, to be a foundation for us to build our hopes of Salvation upon, as well as the Merits of Chriſt, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 6.18,19. <hi>James</hi> 2.19,24 <hi>Ye ſee then, how that by Works a Man is Juſtified, and not by Faith only.</hi> For tho whoever will, is permited to come to Chriſt, yet all they that come to him muſt take his Yoke upon them, that is, Live in Obedience to him, for though Chriſt remains an Advocate with the Father for Sins of Ignorance and Sins of Infirmity, and Sins of Surprizal, yet wo be to them that willfully give themſelves a liberty to ſin Knowingly; for <hi>Iſrael</hi> was termed the Reprobate Silver; ſo likewiſe 'tis the Chriſtians that relinquiſh their Obedience is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Reprobate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the People of God's Curſe to Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The Great Day of Salvation was, when God was in Chriſt Reconciling the World to Himſelf, which was when the Gentile Nations were firſt taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he then not imputing to them their Treſpaſſes; but when they fell into Sin, and had no love to the ways of the Lord, they were then left to Deluſion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then it was not the great day of Salvation, when they were all given up to worſhip the Beaſt, but thoſe whoſe names are written in the Lambs Book of Life from the Foundation, the which were the Remnant choſen from among <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from whom the Diſciples of Chriſt ſprang, and of whom Chriſt ſaid,
<hi>None ſhould pluck them out of his hand;</hi> and to whom he promiſed to be with to the end of the World; and likewiſe that he would forſake none whilſt they keep the way.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. Man was intruſted with the Word for his Poſterity, as <hi>Adam</hi> was with Eternal Life in Paradice for his; and God accordingly laid his commands, that they ſhould not add to the Word, nor diminiſh from it; and the Lord likewiſe annexed thoſe great Threatnings to thoſe that ſhould do either. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18,19.</p>
                  <p>And the Beaſt that has deprived the Nations of the Word, by which God calls to his Creatures to walk in<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45720:318"/>Newneſs of Life <hi>(and he is the Afflicter of them that would yield Obedience to it)</hi> therefore is the moſt ſevere Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance pronounced againſt him; but the Elect Remnant was ſecured by a promiſe from Chriſt, and by further pertaking of the Spirit of God, &amp; that we are none of the Remnant that are thus Elected, is as clear as the Sun in the Firmament; becauſe our Predeceſſors were all decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Beaſt, by whom the Elect Remnant were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceived: as by the word is proved.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. VVhereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God worketh all things, after the Counſel of his own Will.</hi> The Apoſtle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had his referrence to the great works that properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God in carrying on of Man's Redemption, and aiſo in Electing ſome, and ſetting a door of Mercy open to others; and in determining that the great Glory ſhould be for the heirs of the world to come, unto whom the Election did appertain; for not only the Remnant and Firſt Churches, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> will then be the Lords E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and likewiſe all them that are found in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though not Elected, will come in by Chriſt as heirs with them to the promiſed Reward; but the Electing or Fore-chooſing, was according to the will of God, who according to his abundant Mercy to the heirs of Promiſe, will in the time to come, eſtabliſh his Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and theſe are the <hi>Jacob</hi> that he Loved; for <hi>Eſau</hi> and
<hi>Jacob</hi> were made the Repreſentatives of the two Worlds,
<hi>Eſau</hi> of this World, and <hi>Jacob</hi> of that which is to come, as is proved; and they of this World, generally ſell their Birth-right for a meſs of Pottage, rather then they will wreſtle with an Affliction, or withſtand a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; they will part with the hope for promiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which is the Crown of Life: and therefore God ſaid, Jacob <hi>have I Loved and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I Hated:</hi> for all are in this time to wreſtle with the Lord for the Bleſſing, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did. For tho' the Election was not attained by their Willing and Running; yet the promiſed reward is to be attain'd by them that ſo doth, whether Elect or not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45720:318"/>Elect, for all that are found in their Obedience in this time, comes in as heirs to the Promiſes. But before <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi> or
<hi>Jacob</hi> had done Good or Evil, God only ſaid, <hi>The Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger.</hi> And this was ſo ordered by the determinate Counſel of God, that the Elder ſhould ſerve the Younger. That is, all that does not come in as the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> to be heirs to the World to come, the reſt that are then ſpared of this Elder World, <hi>or Eſau Generation,</hi> are then given as Daughters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſervants of them that are ſo, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thus God, as the Potter, has power over his Clay to make one Veſſel to honour and another to diſhonour; but not that God did make any Veſſel to do Evil, that thereby they might become a Veſſel to Diſhonour.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. And though God ſaid, <hi>That he will ſhew Mercy on whom he will ſhew Mercy, and whom he will he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> yet his Will is guided, as he is the fountain of all Reaſon, with greater Reaſon than we can imagin. For after God had choſen <hi>Abraham,</hi> it was then according to his obedient walking that he became heir to the Promiſes; for which Promiſe ſake, God did at the appointed time, appear to deliver
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo he will again at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time; but then for
<hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Cruelty and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſlavery to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God did then for his Sin harden him in unbelief, ſo as he ſhould not believe the Miracles done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that thereby he might ſhew his power on him, by deſtroying him and his Army in the Red Sea: and therefore as in the margent of the Bible, it is ſaid, <hi>God made him ſtand.</hi> That is, Stand in the place of power that he was in, till he himſelf came in the Clouds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him in the Sea. So likewiſe, tho God Elected ſome of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and left a door of Mercy open to others, and left others of them to Blindneſs; yet it was thoſe that were left to Blindneſs, that was moſt wicked among them, and ſuch as had the greater power to promote the knowledge of the fear of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

And there is a Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the VVorld to come, for ſome, and none ſhall be puniſhed in that body in which they never took pleaſure to commit Iniquity. Now whereas the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>God worketh all things,</hi> the word <hi>all,</hi> in Scripture, doth not include the whole, as I have elſ-where proved.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. And God is not the author of the evil of Sin, although he is the author of the evil of Puniſhment, but upon mans repenting and returning, God hath often repented him of the Evil he thought to do unto them, as by the word is proved, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7,8,9,10. <hi>Joel</hi>
2.13,14 <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.9,10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6,7. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
18.20,21,22,23,24. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.18,19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.6. <hi>I am weary with Repenting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas God ſaith Mal 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord I Change not,</hi> This God ſpake as to his Attributes, as his Juſtice, Mercy and Truth in which he is an Unchangable Being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his promiſe ſake it is, that the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are not conſumed; for in time to come they are to inherit the Land.</p>
                  <p>But when God promiſeth a Bleſſing without condition, then he Repenteth not, <hi>For God is not a man that he ſhould Lye, neither the Son of Man that be ſhould Repent: Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpoken and ſhall he not make it good? for God hath promiſed to Bleſs Iſrael, and they ſhall be Bleſſed; and then will he behold no Iniquity in Jacob, when he hath purged all Iniquity from them.</hi> For both in the Old and New Teſtament, thoſe things which are to come, are mentioned, as though they were already paſt, or preſent; ſo accordingly St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating about the Covenant, ſometimes expreſſeth himſelf as though it were already done, that is, Eſtabliſht; but by the whole ſcope of his words he doth fully declare to the contrary, but that they were then given the Holy Ghoſt, which did bear witneſs with their Spirit, they<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45720:319"/>they were choſen to be heirs of that promiſed Covenant; but if they did again willfully Sin, and ſo do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, then there remained for them no more ſacrifice for Sin, but a fearful looking for of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fiery Indignation; for if they ſinned wilfully under the greater Light, they fell under the greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: for although among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were the Remnant that was ſecured by a promiſe from Chriſt, <hi>that none ſhould pluck them out of his hand;</hi> but they ſtood not by the eſtabliſhing of the Everlaſting Covenant, but by a promiſe from Chriſt, that they ſhould not only be heirs to it, but inheritors of it; and when the Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is Eſtabliſhed, then by that Covenant, Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſecured as well to the Body as the Soul; for then the Souls of the Raiſed Saints will be again United to their Bodies, and bleſſed in them; and ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the True Believers, will not only then by that Covenant, have an Inherent Perfect Righteouſneſs, but they will then be freed from Sickneſs, Sorrow, Want, and the troubles that are now in this Life, and in the time to come, in which God will manifeſt his power, he will then alſo make his People
<hi>Iſrael</hi> a willing People; &amp; then it is he will eſtabliſh his Everlaſting Covenant with them, for the good of them and their Children after them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. For this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Covenant was to be eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed together in their Generation. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7,8. And when the Lord again comes to Reſtore all things, he will then make Mount Sion an Eternal Excellency, and the Joy of many Generations; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.15. And then not only the Remnant, but likewiſe the body of the Natural Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> will then be the Lords Elect, which he will gather from the four winds into which he hath driven them.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. The Chriſtians of the Gentile Race, that comes in by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were all termed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in the Old Teſtament as is proved: ſo as the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſtroke threatned in the Goſpel, will fall on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that ſhall be found in Rebellion and Darkneſs at<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45720:320"/>that day, for the Law and Goſpel ſpeak but to them that are under it; therefore they are the World that will be condemned by it, that will not live in Obedience to it; <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not reckoned with the World, therefore the Lord ordered Proclamation to be made to the end of the world, <hi>Say ye to the daughter of Sion, Behold thy Salvation cometh, behold his Reward is with him,</hi> Iſa. 62.11. Thereby ſhewing the power of this world will be taken away when their Salvation cometh.</p>
                  <p n="18">XVIII. In the Word there is mention made of Three Evers, Three Times, Three Generations, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſaid, he would come before this Generation paſſeth away; and the Three Worlds ſpoken of, is the old World, this World, and the World to come, unto whom the Bleſſing is promiſed of the eſtabliſhing the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, which crowns Life to the Soul, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Raiſed Saints, but to Iſrael and all that long for his Appearing, and according to his Word, in an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent frame wait for him. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>To lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.19.</p>
                  <p n="19">XIX. There is likewiſe figarative Heavens and Earth ſpoken of in ſcripture. And the Lord, becauſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> ſinfulneſs, for which they were left to blindneſs; he therefore ſpake to them in parables, all theſe things being now at the appointed time rightly underſtood, it turns the ſcene, whereby the Viſion of the coming of the Lord is made ſo plain, that he that runs may read it.</p>
                  <p>And when the Lord comes, the true Chriſtian will be gathered as the Lord hath declared, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> will then be gathered according as God by his Prophets to them hath revealed, whoſe teſtimony they have received and then will the Lord gather in others with them.</p>

                  <p>I here gather ſo many heads together, that thro' the miſinterpretation of the Scriptures, Satan might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile ſo many of their Souls; for if we take a text of Scripture as it ſtands alone, without weighing how it is<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45720:322"/>ſpoken, and what the whole ſcope of the Scripture tends to, we may raiſe as falce Doctrine as God is True.</p>
                  <p>O God who of thy great Mercy hath made thy word plain in thoſe things we have been miſtaken in, give more of thy Aſſiſting Grace, for to improve the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things which are here but hinted, with the other diſputable places, and alſo the ſigns of the Times, with the near approach of the coming of the Lord, are now fully explained and proved in about four ſmall Treatiſes</p>
                  <p>The Books contain ſo many ſeveral heads that I have not here room to incert them, but by them the word is ſo plain, that none need any longer remain in miſtakes, that are willing to underſtand the Truth. I ſhall only here mention the chief Title of each Book. Firſt, The Explaination of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Price bound 10.
